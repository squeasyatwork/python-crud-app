For example, Drop down menus are critical to any website. However, he does not spend more than 5 seconds (that's right, 5 seconds) in explaining how to create drop down menus. In project 5 (Recipe website) he says that he has created dropdown menus using Superfish plugin and that we also can do the same. However, Superfish plugin requires good amount of settings to be in place which he does not explain at all. This left me looking for explanations on youtube and google. It was immense effort and I thought if I had to do this than what is point of taking this course. If you do not even learn how to create dropdown menus than that course is useless.\n\n2) All the projects that he mentions we are going to do (ecommerce website, recipe website, news website) are a hogwash.

He glides through complex topics like block layout settings, menus etc.\n\n3) I posted by question in QNA section and there was no response. This instructor has a way of avoiding complex topics, explanations.\n\nI am very disheartened and I can only strongly adivse others to stay away from this course.

He typically includes just the basic resource material, then requires you to fetch or make up the balance on your own.   To best focus my time on \"learning Drupal\" (rather than finding content on the web or day dream making stuff up), I wish he included all of it in the downloadable content.  This will not only speed things up for the students, but it will also improve error checking (if my site does not look EXACTLY like his, I know I have to research something).  He was way to brief on the Superfish module set up & install... either tell us how to do it in more detail, or remove it.  I personally made the first ~3/4 websites as recommended by the course, but after wasting an hour+ trying to get Superfish working on the recipe website, I quit attempting to build my own and only watched the lessons.  I do like a style he used in the last 1-2 lectures.

That's impossible to do without stopping and restarting the videos a thousand times because the instructor decided to race through those areas of instruction for some reason in favor of endlessly going over the various Drupal functions. While I understand some repetition is necessary, I found myself mentally checking out during a handful of videos because of how often things were repeated. \n\nThere are videos that need updates to incorporate changes to Drupal 8. You can find information about the changes if you dig through the downloadable resources, but it's on you to do it. There's no mention in any of the videos anywhere that the information is there or how to find it. I literally stumbled across some of the information I needed while poking around in a download file, looking for something else entirely.\n\nAll in all, I'm thankful I took another Drupal 8 course before this one.
