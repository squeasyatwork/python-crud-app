The course does require a good OOP/PHP understanding. This is not a course for the PHP beginner in my opinion. When I did have issues with my code, I was able to figure it out on my own due to the thoroughness of the instructor. When taking on a framework like this you should be at a point where you don't require any hand holding, because it looks like your questions will not be answered soon, looks like you are on your own here. The course moves along at a medium to fast pace, not too slow, not too fast. The instructor does an excellent job of explaining why you are doing things. The instructor leaves the application very usable, but incomplete for the student to complete as an exercise of the newly acquired knowledge, I like this approach.
