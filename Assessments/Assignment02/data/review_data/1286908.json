Easy to follow. But you know those learning to draw an owl courses. First a circle, then another circle. And the next step is a superrealistic owl. \nThis course is a lot like that. \nAnother thing I didn't like is the use of Yarn instead of NPM create-react-app. Hours are spend unnecessarily. Only interesting if you want to learn that stuff in stead of creating something creative. Also a lot of problems arise when using both. \nSo after a while my project wasn't working. So I needed the resource project you can download. But that comes also with a ton of errors. Which I had to address error after error.  \nAnd that's my last negative. The end result is literally a todo-list and a financial app. Nobody is using that. Spreadsheet and software like it are developed since the beginning of computers.

The amount of reworking the example Indecision app became too confusing to follow and I found I was just typing along.  I have done all the challenges up to and including section 7. There doesn't seem to be a linear progression in building the app, it jumps from one technique to another when a new tool is introduced and code is then removed and reworked. The configurations of Babel, Webpack are done in good detail but the example app is overly reworked. I get the instructor is trying to demonstrate how to turn a monolithic codebase into smaller files and installing tools along the way. The problem is side-tracking to tools and returning to the code and reworking it depending on the tool just installed is exhausting and just too confusing to be able to flow along smoothly. Its far better to get all the tools in place and introduce different techniques with simple examples and then build the app with the final preferred technique in one continuous series of videos. By the time I got through section 6, Webpack, I'd lost the flow of the code on the example app in section 7. Probably section 6 and 7  should be looked at again I found after the whole WebPack section I had lost my thread on the concepts learnt in the earlier sections, especially and critically about passing state and communications between components. It's a really detailed course but in some places maybe moves too fast where the instructor could spend more time to reinforce concepts and maybe labours too much on details that soon become reworked and redundant.\n\nUPDATE: I have decided to continue and persevere with the course and completed Part 1. of the course the first example App, which I feel good about and have increased the rating to 4.5. \nI actually went and bought another React course but decided that one was not for me so abandoned it and came back to this one.\nUPDATE 2\nI have now got to video lecture 107. Since my last review the course has stepped up a notch and gone into Redux, state management, touched on regular expressions and a whole lot of other stuff. I have mostly followed along but got lost in a couple of the challenges. What I'm still struggling with is the syntax. most of my errors are missing curly braces or using brackets where there should be braces or missing brackets and semi-colons. I've actually supplemented a pure javascript course to help with those issues and get more practice with the syntax. The styling Indecision example app was nice and gave a sense of achievement. The Higher order component was a little confusing not in concept but in syntax and figuring out how to work it. I think once the whole project is completed it may be easier to sit back and review it in its entirety and see how it all hangs together. At the moment its like making a jigsaw without the end picture but it's getting there. Some of the section 11,  20 min videos have taken me an hour to get through just because of a small typo I made in the challenge or whilst typing along to the lecture and then trying to fix that as well as trying to understand the concept.\nUPDATE: \nI just completed section 11, I say completed but I actually gave up trying to follow along coding by the final video in the section. The content was moving too fast, too confusing and way too much to take onboard for a single video trying to build on top of many new concepts already. The whole example application is way too complex to learn with, adding dates into the mix and a third party library makes this project large and I find myself getting lost in details and moving away from the objective which is to understand react. It was the same pattern with the first example which became too confusing. Just slow it down and be really clear on what is being developed and the interactions between the codebase. The course is good to learn  tooling and even javascript syntax but the project is not great to follow along, too big and unwieldy, lots of effort to get small results. In the final video there were not even any challenges as it was way too complex. I think the intention from the instructor was there but the execution becomes clearly too involved as teaching material unless you are willing to go over a whole bunch of videos again and review the code to figure it all out if you have the time, which I would if I felt I would properly learn but I don't think I will, I'm struggling to keep up typing along and listening to audio trying to figure out the context of what is being taught.\nI think I'm going to park this course at Section 11.", "rating": 4.0, "created": "2020-10-01T15:10:58-07:00", "modified": "2020-10-11T08:37:53-07:00", "user_modified": "2020-10-11T08:37:53-07:00", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 2172732, "title": "Code Scribe", "name": "Code", "display_name": "Code Scribe", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "CS"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>A good and detailed course, however I got lost at lecture 61.

Some of the section 11,  20 min videos have taken me an hour to get through just because of a small typo I made in the challenge or whilst typing along to the lecture and then trying to fix that as well as trying to understand the concept.<br>UPDATE: <br>I just completed section 11, I say completed but I actually gave up trying to follow along coding by the final video in the section. The content was moving too fast, too confusing and way too much to take onboard for a single video trying to build on top of many new concepts already. The whole example application is way too complex to learn with, adding dates into the mix and a third party library makes this project large and I find myself getting lost in details and moving away from the objective which is to understand react. It was the same pattern with the first example which became too confusing. Just slow it down and be really clear on what is being developed and the interactions between the codebase. The course is good to learn  tooling and even javascript syntax but the project is not great to follow along, too big and unwieldy, lots of effort to get small results. In the final video there were not even any challenges as it was way too complex. I think the intention from the instructor was there but the execution becomes clearly too involved as teaching material unless you are willing to go over a whole bunch of videos again and review the code to figure it all out if you have the time, which I would if I felt I would properly learn but I don't think I will, I'm struggling to keep up typing along and listening to audio trying to figure out the context of what is being taught.<br>I think I'm going to park this course at Section 11.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 27272528, "content": "This is my third react course on Udemy. third being due to the fact its just not sticking, but im only like 20% through this and i feel i have learnt more in 20% of basic functionality than i have in 2 full courses. i know to include super(props) in constructor.. but no one ever said why. you went through thoroughly on why and that is just one of the main things i love about this course, you dont skip anything. even vanilla Js examples to help the transfer process.

He not only gives an excellent in-depth review and walk-through of React, but he does deep dives into important concepts along the way, like ES6 classes, arrow functions, and variable declarations.\n\nI took Andrew's original course on React and it was good, but it was prior to React 13, and so the course used some methods and functions that weren't as relevant today.  While I was mostly interested in just updating my existing applications, I decided it would be worth it to brush up on what's changed and the standard way of building React applications.  So far, I am glad that I did.  The previous course was great, but now over 18 months later, not only have we moved on from ES5, we've moved well into ES6 and starting to imagine the future of JavaScript, and so the new course is focused squarely on that.

Beyond that, he is clear and concise in descriptions, and because I was familiar with a lot of the early content, I was able to set the talking speed to 2x and not miss anything.\n\nThe course structure is good as well, with most videos introducing a concept, doing some co-development, and then challenging the student to implement a similar feature in their sandbox.

It is an extremely in-depth course.

The other one didn't teach Redux and gave the simplest bare bones instructions on how to get started with React. I would have never guessed there could be so much more to it.\n\nI am really thankful that all of these details were included because I can't imagine how difficult it would be to research all this stuff and figure it out on my own. It simply wouldn't happen. After completing this course, I at least have a leg up on figuring out how to look at this sort of documentation. Not only does it teach React and Redux, it explains several plugins you need to do various things with React and Redux, Babel, Webpack, production and dev configurations (in excruciating detail), Heroku CLI and Git deployment, Jest testing (also in excruciating detail), modern workflow meticulously organized, even a bit of NodeJS and Express to get the React app running on Heroku (painless and helped me really distinguish what NodeJS is compared to React\u2014at this point I think I like NodeJS better, but it's nice to know they can work together.) I want to point out that I absolutely hate Redux, despite the TA insisting it's incredibly simple once you get the hang of it.\n\nI'm about to dive into the Firebase section next, so there's still plenty more to learn. Honestly, I probably have another week or two before I finish the course. I will need to review parts of it if I want to memorize a lot of this stuff, but if I do, then I will be well on my way to being a master not a novice.\n\nThe course is up-to-date, far more in-depth detailed and organized than any course I've ever seen (and I've taken a lot of courses).\n\nAndrew and his TA are in the comments section every day answering questions quickly. It is surprising how attentive they are and how incredibly great the TA is at knowing exactly what the problem is and solving it quickly. It's got to be a lot to keep track of but they clearly have no problem keeping track of it.\n\nThe really good thing about this course is if you work with it every day, you will have full code immersion and you can't help but get better at Javascript. Whether or not React is what I want to get paid to do is another matter...but you can't know until you really dive into something like this, so thank you so much, Andrew Mead!", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2019-01-28T20:58:17-08:00", "modified": "2019-01-29T08:06:48-08:00", "user_modified": "2019-01-28T21:24:18-08:00", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 4931400, "title": "Nate S", "name": "Nate", "display_name": "Nate S", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "NS"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>I've been working at this every single day for several hours per day for the last full month.

Not only does it teach React and Redux, it explains several plugins you need to do various things with React and Redux, Babel, Webpack, production and dev configurations (in excruciating detail), Heroku CLI and Git deployment, Jest testing (also in excruciating detail), modern workflow meticulously organized, even a bit of NodeJS and Express to get the React app running on Heroku (painless and helped me really distinguish what NodeJS is compared to React\u2014at this point I think I like NodeJS better, but it's nice to know they can work together.) I want to point out that I absolutely hate Redux, despite the TA insisting it's incredibly simple once you get the hang of it.</p>\n\n<p>I'm about to dive into the Firebase section next, so there's still plenty more to learn. Honestly, I probably have another week or two before I finish the course. I will need to review parts of it if I want to memorize a lot of this stuff, but if I do, then I will be well on my way to being a master not a novice.</p>\n\n<p>The course is up-to-date, far more in-depth detailed and organized than any course I've ever seen (and I've taken a lot of courses).</p>\n\n<p>Andrew and his TA are in the comments section every day answering questions quickly. It is surprising how attentive they are and how incredibly great the TA is at knowing exactly what the problem is and solving it quickly. It's got to be a lot to keep track of but they clearly have no problem keeping track of it.</p>\n\n<p>The really good thing about this course is if you work with it every day, you will have full code immersion and you can't help but get better at Javascript. Whether or not React is what I want to get paid to do is another matter...but you can't know until you really dive into something like this, so thank you so much, Andrew Mead!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 34554604, "content": "Good course, however, using firebase and too much emphasis on testing.

I don't know if the Jest portion of the course could have been integrated differently.  It was very useful to learn, but it got me a little derailed from learning redux.  Overall, a super helpful course.  Worth doing if you are interested in getting into React in a serious way.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 56124628, "content": "Andrew is awesome.
