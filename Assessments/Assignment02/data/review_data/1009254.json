I was happy with the example and basic JS tutorial.  However, setting up the skeleton section is where is went south for me.  Jack isn't teaching, he's coding while you watch and not explaining what he's writing or why he's doing it that way.  There is so much that wasn't covered the in the JS basics.  Then, way too many dependancies.  If any of those packages fail b/c of system or package conflicts, then the whole rest of the course is ruined and useless (which happened to me).  Lastly, it was so painful to watch Jack setup the package file for those dependancies.  Next time, provide the file and move on.  Needless to say, I was not able to complete the course.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 9516796, "content": "I'm a long time Java developer and needed to learn node.js for my current company.

I appreciate the approach of building a project from the start. Couple of suggestions: \n\n- It would be helpful for the presenter to indicate where parts of the API reinforce concepts previously learned in the JS basics portion of the videos. Several times he makes references to the term \"destructuring\" and I don't recall him teaching this during the JS portion of the video.\n- Some of the code that is available to download is not the same as what is taught. In at least one example there is still a holdover of ES5 syntax in the ZIP file resources when he illustrates ES6 \"fat arrow\" functions in the videos.\n- The quizzes are too easy. They are not very deep.\n\nThat said, the material itself is presented in a generally clear way. The presenter is really engaging, and the depth of topic sufficient enough to get people started quickly. Keeping in mind that API design and development is a topic that entire books are dedicated to, this course is a great intro.", "rating": 4.0, "created": "2016-12-16T12:48:54Z", "modified": "2016-12-16T20:49:05Z", "user_modified": "2016-12-16T20:49:05Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 1864356, "title": "Elliot Rodriguez", "name": "Elliot", "display_name": "Elliot Rodriguez", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "ER"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>The videos are generally well laid out.
