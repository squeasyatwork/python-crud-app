I was able to understand many aspects of PHP and advanced OOP by just taking into consideration many of the topics shown and implemented in here.

He shows many slides in which the concept is explained in a simple manner, and then he goes through the code, finally we have a demo of whatever he would be talking at the moment. Truly a great course and best of all, he does provide additional insight if you get stuck, I got stuck with regex concepts and he made sure that I got it right!

I highly recommend this course if you want to understand MVCs. This course is a really, really good way to learn about MVC. Excellent instruction. Thank you!\n\nHaving said that, one thing was just annoying, the inclusion of a template halfway through the course. I found that to be a distracting addition that was not really on topic of the course. I'm not saying templates aren't relevant, but I really think adding one could have been done in a \"bonus\" chapter at the end of the course, since there are a number of code changes to be made. I'm glad it was covered, but really feel like it was in the wrong place.\n\nBeyond that, a couple things I would have preferred... \n\n1. a typealong is always easier to follow. but with so much content I understand why the pages were pre-typed and just explained with a 'walk through'...\n2. The twig 'installation' isn't so cut and dry. I ended up taking the zip file included with the lecture and copy/pasting the install on to my folder structure. Not ideal, nor realistic. That part was disappointing.\n3. The editor used doesn't highlight what directory the open file is in on the sidebar. So, be very careful of the file you are changing or creating. There are redundant files in the directory tree.\n4. Not having a type-along means the student has to stop, type, back up catch a minor change in something else, infer things, and then hope the page renders or start the entire video again. Not ideal.\n\nDespite these points, this is the best MVC course I've studied. And I appreciate the instructors style, explanations and work.

I highly recommend this course if you want to understand MVCs. This course is a really, really good way to learn about MVC. Excellent instruction. Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, one thing was just annoying, the inclusion of a template halfway through the course. I found that to be a distracting addition that was not really on topic of the course. I'm not saying templates aren't relevant, but I really think adding one could have been done in a \"bonus\" chapter at the end of the course, since there are a number of code changes to be made. I'm glad it was covered, but really feel like it was in the wrong place.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that, a couple things I would have preferred... </p>\n\n<p>1. a typealong is always easier to follow. but with so much content I understand why the pages were pre-typed and just explained with a 'walk through'...<br>2. The twig 'installation' isn't so cut and dry. I ended up taking the zip file included with the lecture and copy/pasting the install on to my folder structure. Not ideal, nor realistic. That part was disappointing.<br>3. The editor used doesn't highlight what directory the open file is in on the sidebar. So, be very careful of the file you are changing or creating. There are redundant files in the directory tree.<br>4. Not having a type-along means the student has to stop, type, back up catch a minor change in something else, infer things, and then hope the page renders or start the entire video again.

Course clearly explains how to create a custom Model-View-Controller (MVC) PHP framework from scratch.   In the process, Object Oriented PHP is illustrated.   The course is well organized, and claims to be complete although I am not qualified to compare the safety and efficiency of the resulting custom MVC framework to other frameworks like Laravel or Slim (mentioned in the last lecture).   \n\nSome obvious course design choices were made to keep the course concise.  One of these was the frequent introduction of pre-written code with a brief comment to the effect \"We do it like this...\"  followed by a few seconds screen time showing the resulting code.  In other words, this is not a 'type-along-with-me\" type of course, and I have to trust that the provided code will be the same as that shown and be as clear as the course itself.    I mention this because some other Udemy courses actually create the code, on-the-fly, testing it in segments before your eyes, and this inevitably generates a few errors which create a learning opportunity in how things work.  This course is not designed that way but is probably an equally valid way of presenting the information efficiently.\n\nThe instructor uses AMPPS rather than XAMPP stack, yet appears to be quite Linux friendly.   I had some minor concerns with the installation process on Linux (such as how to properly secure the development server) and I eventually decided to just use Cloud 9 online PHP development environment instead,   The author does offer a discount on his other course that claims to cover the web development environment installation process in detail.  I have not taken that course and probably will not because $10 seems to be a bit pricey for such basic (although important) information.

Course clearly explains how to create a custom Model-View-Controller (MVC) PHP framework from scratch.   In the process, Object Oriented PHP is illustrated.   The course is well organized, and claims to be complete although I am not qualified to compare the safety and efficiency of the resulting custom MVC framework to other frameworks like Laravel or Slim (mentioned in the last lecture).   </p>\n\n<p>Some obvious course design choices were made to keep the course concise.  One of these was the frequent introduction of pre-written code with a brief comment to the effect \"We do it like this...\"  followed by a few seconds screen time showing the resulting code.  In other words, this is not a 'type-along-with-me\" type of course, and I have to trust that the provided code will be the same as that shown and be as clear as the course itself.    I mention this because some other Udemy courses actually create the code, on-the-fly, testing it in segments before your eyes, and this inevitably generates a few errors which create a learning opportunity in how things work.  This course is not designed that way but is probably an equally valid way of presenting the information efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>The instructor uses AMPPS rather than XAMPP stack, yet appears to be quite Linux friendly.   I had some minor concerns with the installation process on Linux (such as how to properly secure the development server) and I eventually decided to just use Cloud 9 online PHP development environment instead,   The author does offer a discount on his other course that claims to cover the web development environment installation process in detail.  I have not taken that course and probably will not because $10 seems to be a bit pricey for such basic (although important) information.  I'm sure I can find that info elsewhere for free, and that it will become outdated quickly.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 10149798, "content": "Very nice course, strict and the author explains everything nicely.
