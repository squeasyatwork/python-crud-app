There's really no reasonable way to live code a project like this on video unless you wanted to spend 200 hours watching it.</p>\n\n<p>I'm curious, what made it difficult to follow?

The way I identify a good technical/software course is by looking at just one thing.\n\nDo they provide any information on Software Testing? \nYou will be surprised how few actually include tests. This one does. It's not TDD but Nick explains the Tests first thing. If you come to work anywhere in the real world and can't write tests, you better get the heck out.\n\nIs it worth the money? Absolutely.\nI have made Flask apps on ad hoc projects but nothing full blown. I learned Rails with much pain and google searches and mentoring. It took an year just to be able to catch up with my experienced team. I wanted to make a full blow Flask app but what stopped me was the hundreds of hours of searching and trial-and-error to get everything right. So it saved me about 400 hours of that.  Yes. thats how long it takes to figure this out on your own.\n\nHow does it compare to other flask courses?\nI don't know. they dont talk about writing tests, so I ignore them.\n\nbonus: the code Nick is giving away is worth thousands. You can use it as template to bootstrap any project. I was quoted over 2500$ for a PHP based app prototype for something similar which I knew I was gonna hate and would be of sub-par quality. This is production ready and good quality code. I do code reviews at work and this is well structured, good library choices, including added features missing from vanilla Flask extensions.\n\ncons: It's not for everyone. If you can't do some of the research (not lots) and try the exercises on your own you will not get anything out of it. I created my own project using his template that I modify as I go along. That helps build the muscle memory he talk about.\nI haven't reached ORM yet, but I believe ORM could use a bit more depth, just looking at highlights here.\n\nI am writing this to let Nick know you're underselling this.

The way I identify a good technical/software course is by looking at just one thing.</p>\n\n<p>Do they provide any information on Software Testing? <br>You will be surprised how few actually include tests. This one does. It's not TDD but Nick explains the Tests first thing. If you come to work anywhere in the real world and can't write tests, you better get the heck out.</p>\n\n<p>Is it worth the money? Absolutely.<br>I have made Flask apps on ad hoc projects but nothing full blown. I learned Rails with much pain and google searches and mentoring. It took an year just to be able to catch up with my experienced team. I wanted to make a full blow Flask app but what stopped me was the hundreds of hours of searching and trial-and-error to get everything right. So it saved me about 400 hours of that.  Yes. thats how long it takes to figure this out on your own.</p>\n\n<p>How does it compare to other flask courses?<br>I don't know. they dont talk about writing tests, so I ignore them.</p>\n\n<p>bonus: the code Nick is giving away is worth thousands. You can use it as template to bootstrap any project. I was quoted over 2500$ for a PHP based app prototype for something similar which I knew I was gonna hate and would be of sub-par quality. This is production ready and good quality code. I do code reviews at work and this is well structured, good library choices, including added features missing from vanilla Flask extensions.</p>\n\n<p>cons: It's not for everyone.

Nick Janetakis dismantles the mysteries of using the Flask framework for application development, by teaching you the functional topology of a properly designed Flask app, with thorough, step-by-step explanations at each stage in the complex project\u2019s development.  Be prepared, this course covers numerous topics in a short period of time, it is a lot of information and if you are not familiar with Flask, which I was not, do yourself a huge favor and study the information on the links Nick provides \u2013 it will assuredly enhance your understanding and reduce the time it takes you to understand each section.

For each section, all the code is already prepared. Even after doing the 'challenge' sections, I don't feel like this course is giving me the skills and knowledge that I need to develop my own web application. How do I manage my local environments and troubleshoot issues? How do I build my own CLI tool instead of using your pre-prepared one? The course materials are well constructed, but the gaps between sessions are just filled in with 'download the code for the next section', which leaves large gaps in knowledge</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 29237699, "content": "Great content, could be 6 stars when the audio do has some short spells to digest the content.
