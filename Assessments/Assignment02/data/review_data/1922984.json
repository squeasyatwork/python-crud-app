It's two 5 hour courses, where the second is the exact same course, on an older version of .NET core.\n\nPatrick spends SOOO much time typing, and narrating what he's typing. In many cases he doesn't bother explaining what he typed, or why. He's so slow. He just tells you to type stuff and moves on, especially during the authentication part.\n\nMOST of the course is him refactoring over and over. When you look back and think about what you've covered, it's barely anything.
