I felt that it successfully taught and demonstrated the use of the 20% needed to get started creating our own pages using thymeleaf along side Spring Boot. I also think that John's usage of git commits at the beginning and end of each section is fantastic. Not only does this expose students to a highly important tool they should be using, but it also means that if you make a mistake during any lecture you can look at the working snapshot that John provides with github and have an easier time finding your mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>I highly recommend this course if you are new to using Thymeleaf with Spring Boot!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 34556562, "content": "Seco el guaton de Spring", "rating": 1.0, "created": "2019-07-21T07:46:35Z", "modified": "2019-07-21T19:03:15Z", "user_modified": "2019-07-21T07:46:35Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 63451230, "title": "Christian Castro", "name": "Christian", "display_name": "Christian Castro", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "CC"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Seco el guaton de Spring</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 28488434, "content": "Great course", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2019-03-10T19:28:56Z", "modified": "2019-04-12T20:14:22Z", "user_modified": "2019-04-12T20:14:22Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 38240398, "title": "Yuki Buwana", "name": "Yuki", "display_name": "Yuki Buwana", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "YB"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Great course</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 7159588, "content": "bacana", "rating": 4.0, "created": "2017-05-26T13:03:50Z", "modified": "2017-06-05T11:41:29Z", "user_modified": "2017-06-05T11:41:29Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 32513916, "title": "Saulo Dias Diniz", "name": "Saulo Dias", "display_name": "Saulo Dias Diniz", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "SD"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>bacana</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 53811744, "content": "Great course, as all the courses from John Thompson!
