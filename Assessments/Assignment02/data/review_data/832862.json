Meteor could have been handled in a bit more depth.</p>\n\n<p>For those who'd like to get to grips with Meteor only it might not be the best choice. For React/Meteor it's obviously great and I'd recommend it. Since I learned quite a bit and am back in the Meteor boat after a long break I'm happy to reward 4 stars.
