Vasco (the instructor) provides answers to these types of questions most of the time.  But I think instructors in general should provide more answers, more often, to these interrogations that you have all the time as a developer when you have multiple technologies that could accomplish the same task.  Because a framework as a feature for something doesn't mean it's the BEST way to accomplish that task.  This is always tricky with the new and shiny technologies, and I would like to hear more opinions from the instructors in advanced courses.  But others could find that it's bloating the course...  So it's more of a personal wish than a criticism.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, an amazing course with a great instructor!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 43714852, "content": "It's an awesome course.
