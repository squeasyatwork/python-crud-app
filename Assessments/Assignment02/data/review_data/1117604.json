This course does not only accomplish that but also gives a good introduction to frameworks and plugins and shows in detail how to use and integrate them into the website. <br>The course is presented in a pleasant way, and it is easy to follow. Although at times I would have wished a more detailed explanation on certain aspects, e.g how to integrate a real blog and how to receive a contact form on the server. Explanations, not the code to implement it because that would have definitely exceeded the scope of this course.<br>It would be nice if Irfan would do an advanced course addressing the above items and serverside programming in general taking the Solo website as base.<br>I can highly recommend this course to anybody who wants to learn how a website is created with more than just HTML/CSS <br>An extra bonus is a categorized 4-page list with url\u2019s of websites useful for web development.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 19797932, "content": "Really good instructor!
