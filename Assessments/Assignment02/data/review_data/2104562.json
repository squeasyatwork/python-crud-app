It moves quickly, so this course is probably best for developers with at least moderate prior experience with Node and JavaScript, including ES6++ language features.  Dave Irvine, the instructor, is very knowledgeable and thoroughly prepared.  My favorite thing about this course is the code quality, demonstrating good use of Modern JavaScript.  If you already know Node, Express, MongoDB, and Jest, but want to see how to use them wrapped in Modern JavaScript with async/await, this course is a good survey.  Hoping for additional courses by Dave Irvine in the future.", "rating": 4.5, "created": "2019-01-09T15:59:58Z", "modified": "2019-01-11T11:05:07Z", "user_modified": "2019-01-09T19:23:34Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 28446152, "title": "Jim Fathman", "name": "Jim", "display_name": "Jim Fathman", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "JF"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>This is a fine course on Node.js.
