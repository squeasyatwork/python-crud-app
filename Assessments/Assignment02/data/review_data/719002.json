But this course makes me start working. Mosh does a great job! </p>\n\n<p>I also like the web-class-approach to get teached whenever *I* am ready. I repeat parts of the class to get the tasks on the end of the lections done, so I can focus on things I missed the first time watching it.</p>\n\n<p>I also like to watch or repeat parts on my iphone. I can read the code shown also on this little device easily.</p>\n\n<p>Mosh was doing a really good job. The excercises after some lessons are _very_ motivating and I could programm little useful well known components. The lessons are great to program along with the teacher. </p>\n\n<p>But there is a frustrating gap between beta and final version of Angular 2. Everything starts well with a downloadable seedprojekt made in Angular2/beta. In the middle of the complete course there are lections with observables, everything broke down when trying to program along because jquery($-variable) was biting proteractor($-variable). I could not deal with it and restarted the course with angular-final and angular-cli. But also with the \"latest changes\" I could not make the gap from beta to final of Angular2. At this point I was working for 10 days to make the course run again with Angular2/final. In the end I gave up. The Questions and Answers from udemy are a great idea, but did not help enough. </p>\n\n<p>What I think: Mosh is really a GREAT teacher. But with sooo many students the course should be made fresh with the final version of Angular2.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 31583996, "content": "Some interesting content but overall are outdated, could have been updated to the latest version with extra content (video or static content) like other Udemy's instructors do.", "rating": 3.5, "created": "2019-05-17T08:28:21Z", "modified": "2019-05-17T19:04:57Z", "user_modified": "2019-05-17T08:31:52Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 27995254, "title": "L.

I have taken other courses of his as well and have found each one of them amazing.</p>\n\n<p>My only complaint with this course is that it lacks 1 video where the student should be taught how to create a new Angular project with a specific Angular/cli version. As when creating a new project, by default the version is set to the current version (i.e. 7.0 at present) while the course teaches version 4.0.</p>\n\n<p>Now some of the stuff that was a part of Angular 4, has been deprecated now (like HTTP). But a student working with a new project with Angular version set to 7 (which he may not be aware of) will face many issues while following the HTTP section of this course.</p>\n\n<p>So please add a video teaching to create a new Angular project with a specific version and then this course will deserve nothing less than a 5-star.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 2677430, "content": "Good course.

This was a good course when I bought it but I am giving it 2 stars for a couple of reasons.\n\n1. The course is not updated to the final version of Angular 2, though the final version has been out for a while now.\n\n2. Instead of re-working the videos to update the content and code examples, he has added sections at the end that lists the changes. This creates a difficult learning experience for a beginner as code they learn in the first few videos does not work correctly and they have to scroll all the way to the end to get the latest changes. This is not an optimum learning experience for a beginner.\n\n3. The instructor is unresponsive on the Discussion Forums. As a beginner, you will have questions and not having those questions answered leads to a subpar learning experience. There are questions in the forum that have been unanswered for the past 25 days!!\n\nIMHO, this was a good course when it started, but the lack of updates and a lack of response from the instructor have really brought this down.

The course is not updated to the final version of Angular 2, though the final version has been out for a while now.</p>\n\n<p>2. Instead of re-working the videos to update the content and code examples, he has added sections at the end that lists the changes. This creates a difficult learning experience for a beginner as code they learn in the first few videos does not work correctly and they have to scroll all the way to the end to get the latest changes. This is not an optimum learning experience for a beginner.</p>\n\n<p>3. The instructor is unresponsive on the Discussion Forums.

I would like to review that this currently is THE most painless way for beginners to get to know Angular2 so far. Mosh is a cool guy that introduces the concepts incrementally to you in a way that does not let you get overwhelm with information. And he never keys a new line of code without telling you what it is for. The final part is he also encourages you to be independent with coding exercises.
