He does not give any instructions on what database to use and how to set up the entity framework with any database. He directly starts enabling the migrations which yields all sort of problems which are not resolved even after spending 2 hours on getting that up and running. I am extremely disappointed with the instructor and the quality of this course. I am not concerned about the money here but the time spent on this crap course is what bothers me the most. I could have spent this time in doing something more productive. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you for nothing Mosh. Your course is going to archives now !</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 6227598, "content": "Course moves quickly,  if your attention strays you will miss key steps and have to go back.

He literally spends the first 17 videos showing you the wrong way to do something over and over again.</p>\n\n<p>That wouldn't be so bad if there were regular exercises to fill in the gaps. First exercise comes 17 videos in. And it's a train wreck, absolute train wreck. No skeleton code is provided. I spent 6 hours on what should've been a 20 minute exercise, with little progress. His solution file is a poorly managed github repo. And I want to emphasize the hundreds of comments on his github solution repo, of utterly baffled students.</p>\n\n<p>Section 03 \"Working with Data\" is completely broken. Again, the instructor does not provide project files. Follow his instructions, and you are literally broken 37 seconds into that section. There are no workarounds. Since the course builds on one project, the rest of the course is rendered un-followable. The FAQ's do not address it either. Nor do you gain anything from just listening (he never explains what 'migrations' are).</p>\n\n<p>This 'course' was an utter waste of time, and it has done more damage than good to my understanding. It is not worth $189, nor does it merit such a high rating. I strongly believe udemy should take this course down.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 12194592, "content": "Untill now i purchased almost 4 MVC course and after only 1 day i returned them back..but in the second lesson i feel this course what i am searching for.\nVoice, quality, sequance and everything is perfect untill now. \nSpecial offer for Turkish people who scared about English, is really teacher accent is very clear and you dont miss any word with subtitle support.\nThank you.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2017-12-29T04:29:35Z", "modified": "2018-05-22T15:20:04Z", "user_modified": "2017-12-29T07:10:54Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 36331236, "title": "Murat Capanoglu", "name": "Murat", "display_name": "Murat Capanoglu", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "MC"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Untill now i purchased almost 4 MVC course and after only 1 day i returned them back..but in the second lesson i feel this course what i am searching for.<br>Voice, quality, sequance and everything is perfect untill now. <br>Special offer for Turkish people who scared about English, is really teacher accent is very clear and you dont miss any word with subtitle support.<br>Thank you.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 11064858, "content": "Ce cours m'a permis de surpasser mes capacit\u00e9s , car je pensais  qu'on devrait seulement connaitre un seul langage pour s'en sortir , le monde de l'employabilit\u00e9 , va \u00e0 une vitesse exponentielle, et c'est bien d'apprendre davantage ,j'aimerai \u00eatre un instructeur \u00e0 Udemy, car plusieurs jeunes comme moi souhaiteraient avoir cette formation ...\nMerci Udemy\nMerci Mr Mosh Hamedani", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2017-11-17T08:46:42Z", "modified": "2018-05-22T15:18:24Z", "user_modified": "2017-11-17T19:03:18Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 31259756, "title": "ALAIN PIERRE NGANKEU", "name": "ALAIN PIERRE", "display_name": "ALAIN PIERRE NGANKEU", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/31259756_5696_2.jpg", "initials": "AN"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Ce cours m'a permis de surpasser mes capacit\u00e9s , car je pensais  qu'on devrait seulement connaitre un seul langage pour s'en sortir , le monde de l'employabilit\u00e9 , va \u00e0 une vitesse exponentielle, et c'est bien d'apprendre davantage ,j'aimerai \u00eatre un instructeur \u00e0 Udemy, car plusieurs jeunes comme moi souhaiteraient avoir cette formation ...<br>Merci Udemy<br>Merci Mr Mosh Hamedani</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 24114831, "content": "Interesuj\u0105cy, prosty", "rating": 4.5, "created": "2018-12-05T12:46:44Z", "modified": "2018-12-05T18:03:00Z", "user_modified": "2018-12-05T12:49:12Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 59031072, "title": "Miros\u0142aw Kokoci\u0144ski", "name": "Miros\u0142aw", "display_name": "Miros\u0142aw Kokoci\u0144ski", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "MK"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Interesuj\u0105cy, prosty</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 16064504, "content": "awesome mosh", "rating": 4.5, "created": "2018-04-29T10:24:53Z", "modified": "2018-05-22T15:25:40Z", "user_modified": "2018-04-29T10:24:53Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 47690476, "title": "Ashutosh Tayade", "name": "Ashutosh", "display_name": "Ashutosh Tayade", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "AT"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>awesome mosh</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 8961832, "content": "Not done yet", "rating": 4.0, "created": "2017-08-21T10:53:38Z", "modified": "2018-05-22T15:15:05Z", "user_modified": "2017-08-22T09:34:32Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 35298248, "title": "Jeremiah Halstead", "name": "Jeremiah", "display_name": "Jeremiah Halstead", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "JH"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Not done yet</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 3362190, "content": "basic so far", "rating": 4.5, "created": "2016-09-06T20:43:45Z", "modified": "2016-09-07T03:43:54Z", "user_modified": "2016-09-07T03:43:54Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 1004288, "title": "Christian Sanabria Jim\u00e9nez", "name": "Christian", "display_name": "Christian Sanabria Jim\u00e9nez", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/1004288_700d_2.jpg", "initials": "CS"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>basic so far</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "5 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 43462740, "content": "Yes...

The student will find themselves confused and wondering how things got done when it was the magic of resharper doing it for Mosh.<br>EDIT AGAIN:  I got almost halfway through this course and found that much has changed from when this was created to when I viewed this course.  And no offense to the teacher assistant, but all he does, if you have a question regarding the course, is tell you to check your code via github.  Mosh does not monitor this course or its questions.  Sadly I wasted $13 on it, whereas it's not a big deal, I did learn some things, but I just can't complete the course.  Hard as I try, I run into more & more issues\\questions with each passing lecture that I force myself on to the next lecture hoping it will get better.  Unfortunately it does not.<br>The course needs serious updating which I don't think will happen.  <br>Buyer beware with this course.  I do not recommend it, at all.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 88551696, "content": "This course is best for beginners .

Also the exercises truly need a video explaining his solution in a little more depth, rather than less than 2 minutes of showing where to go find the code to his solution from github that contains code not previously seen, particularly Exercise 2 that has some LINQ code.  Then in section 3 he introduces LINQ, some form of introduction to it should have been established in section 2 before an exercise that requires it.

The course was reasonably well presented and the exercises proved useful but often weren't explained clearly leaving me wondering what was expected.\n\nAs the course went on however, more and more errors creeped in and often were fixed in later lectures leaving you to wonder what had you done wrong at the time - a perfect example of this is a known bug in typeahead which, for someone less experienced would have struggled.

One of the best I have taken on Udemy. The sample project is big enough to be an effective learning experience and Mosh walks through the whole process in an orderly fashion. \n\nHe explains each step and provides a variety of ways to do things. You get exposure to multiple approaches without being overwhelmed. One of the things l like about Mosh's classes is that he demonstrates a variety of tools and techniques and this class is no exception. You will come away with a number of potential tools to add to your web developer's developers toolkit.\n\nThe only improvement I would suggest is in Section 1, Lecture 4, add a small call-out to make sure students change the default authentication setting when initially creating the class project. The latest versions of Visual Studio have a different default setting than what was used in the video and that small change has a big impact on getting the Entity Framework working later on. For students with prior experience with Entity Framework this is probably not a problem but for newer folks it can be quite difficult (as evidenced by some comments on the Q&A board).\n\nThere are a few other very minor things that have changed in the tools and packages used due to new versions being released since the video was recorded but they aren't too bad and even beginners should be able to work past them.\n\nFor any beginners reading this far, at the beginning of the class Mosh outlines some prerequisite knowledge considerations for beginners vs more experienced students. I strongly recommend beginners take his advice to heart. My recommendation is that beginners consider going through his Entity Framework (EF) class BEFORE taking this class if they do not have prior experience with EF. There is plenty to learn in this class just focusing on ASP. EF is covered enough to get you up and running in this class but it is a steep curve if you have no prior experience and you will only get a VERY narrow exposure to the framework. The EF class moves along quickly so it doesn't take a lot of time. Having that EF knowledge going in to this ASP class will allow you to focus on learning ASP instead of trying to learn both ASP and EF at the same time.  \n\nThanks for a great course Mosh.
