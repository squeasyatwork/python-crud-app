I followed him over here from Safari/Eduonix. His courses are very good and I have purchase several. Brad does move a bit too fast though. I know he's trying to get through the material expeditiously, but he sometimes makes mistakes and has to go back and fix them. If he slowed down a tad, that could actually *save* time not having to retrace his steps. \n\nAREAS OF IMPROVEMENT: I also wish Brad would explain **WHY** he is making the decisions he makes in the code. The preliminary videos were a good primer, but I took this course over an entire month and didn't remember some of the things he discussed in earlier lessons. It would have been nice to get more detail and theory behind what he was doing so that I could not only *learn HOW*, but *understand WHY*. For example, it would be nice for him to give a brief overview of the BS4 components used in each project.

However, I have one wish for future courses:<br>at some points you glossed over some (for me) important details on how you troubleshoot problems. For example during the last resume project you add a media-query and say you had to play around with css to get this to work correctly and I think it would be nice if you would further explain your workflow and HOW you troubleshoot stuff like that.

Second half of the course is applying the Bootstrap 4 knowledge through code-along projects. The projects are excellent for re-enforcing concepts gained in the first 1/2 of the course. Explanations are crystal clear and your ability to use Bootstap 4 quickly accelerates, especially if you play the video, and then try it yourself, and then compare your code to the final code to determine errors.

What was annoying to me is that you feel he is copying them from a paper or editor in front of him in monotone way. No explanation to why we have this margin per example. Why this needs a data-toggle attribute etc... It is like he is showcasing to you what Bootstrap can do; not why it do it the way it do it and more important how you can change the default  behavior. Although to be fair He tackled  that later quite quickly when he showed how to change one of SCSS (SASS) files of Bootstrap itself.\nAnother example, he did not explain 'clearfix' class, why it is needed? and what is the problem here? - I had to read some stackoverflow answers to understand more. Things of this sort.\nThe instructor also has an extremely annoying tendency of assigning like over 50 classes (without explaining them) to like 50 elements and then refreshing the page to let you see the result. As if we are supposed to understand the 'aggregate effect' of all CSS classes used, instead of showing what each class is doing really, this can be seen  when he was explaining the nav bar, the forms among many many others....

This is good, this is how work gets done in the real world.
