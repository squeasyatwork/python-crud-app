His recording setup is fine for the most part, though you will be distracted by background noises, and notification popups, etc. \n\nThe pros:\n\n1. He really doesn't teach you about Jekyll and now to create a Jekyll blog via the command line i.e. \"Jekyll new my-first-blog\". Instead, you'll take a pre-existing Bootstrap site, and convert it to the Jekyll format.  \n\nThis is actually pretty neat since by the time you are done, and if you want to start from scratch, with the default boilerplate that Jekyll uses to create a site, you will already know what the various liquid syntaxes are and what to do with them. Plus you will have the added knowledge of actually breaking down a site you may have or from another static site framework like Hugo or Middleman and how to convert it to Jekyll. \n\n2. The recording is from 2014 but a lot of the stuff still applies today.  \n\n3. If you've never hosted a site on github, then this lecture got you covered. Even goes over how to add your own domain name. He also mentions some cool resources that you might not know about.  Cool stuff to add to your developer toolbox (You will have to pause the vid to jot it down though).\n\n\nThis is a shotgun style lecture so if you have basic HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge, you will be able to follow along quickly (though you don't really add any of that in this course). He explains some things, but there are some areas where he could have gone into more detail that he didn't.  So you will still have to research on your own. \n\nI mean honestly, I didn't think I would gain any value out of this course after watching the first couple videos, but to my surprise, I actually learned quite a bit and I do have a nice sense of what Jekyll is and how to use it.
