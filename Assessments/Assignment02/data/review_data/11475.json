I am only giving it two stars when really, it deserves a negative one! I am not kidding. I really just want my money back at this juncture. I got burned twice and although I took most of his course. I can not use it most of it because it is archaic. IT is pointless...go to Rob Perceival. He knows how to teach a course and to update his material with the times. Enough on him. Back to this instructor. I will give him this. He is thorough like a preacher and he definitely does not \"cut-corners\" on his teaching. His approach can get redundant, but he comes from a different school of thought and I guess, we all need to appreciate that. All in all, this could be a great class.

I gave the course a five-star rating. </p>\n\n<p>Since I've started the Javascript section, I've been fighting the homework because I want to record all of the steps as I learn them, which doesn't seem to be the point of the homework. The \"answer sheet\" only shows the very last few stages of instructions, which gets incredibly confusing when I'm stuck earlier on. Being able to compare between previous steps and new steps has always been the best way for me to learn coding, so I am having to deviate from the homework instructions simply to keep the older information with the new. </p>\n\n<p>I'm still glad I have gotten this course, because I am learning, but having to fight what should be fairly straightforward labs is very frustrating.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "5 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 5763292, "content": "great start easy to understand", "rating": 4.5, "created": "2017-03-02T23:50:21Z", "modified": "2017-03-03T07:50:21Z", "user_modified": "2017-03-03T07:50:21Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 23531260, "title": "Omar Tapia", "name": "Omar", "display_name": "Omar Tapia", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/23531260_95c3.jpg", "initials": "OT"}, "response": {"_class": "course_review_response", "id": 412818, "content": "Thank you for enrolling Omar and thanks for the review!", "created": "2017-03-06T06:00:16Z", "modified": "2017-03-06T06:00:16Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 11439, "title": "Framework Tech Media", "name": "Framework Tech", "display_name": "Framework Tech Media", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/11439_12bd_11.jpg", "initials": "FM"}, "content_html": "<p>Thank you for enrolling Omar and thanks for the review!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, "content_html": "<p>great start easy to understand</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 13182186, "content": "Bardzo fachowo", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2018-01-27T13:20:55Z", "modified": "2018-05-22T15:21:06Z", "user_modified": "2018-01-27T21:09:00Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 42610672, "title": "Piotr Izdebski", "name": "Piotr", "display_name": "Piotr Izdebski", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "PI"}, "response": {"_class": "course_review_response", "id": 1057868, "content": "Thank you for enrolling Bardzo and thank you very much for a perfect review!", "created": "2018-01-29T07:19:23Z", "modified": "2018-01-29T07:19:23Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 11439, "title": "Framework Tech Media", "name": "Framework Tech", "display_name": "Framework Tech Media", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/11439_12bd_11.jpg", "initials": "FM"}, "content_html": "<p>Thank you for enrolling Bardzo and thank you very much for a perfect review!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, "content_html": "<p>Bardzo fachowo</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 57243950, "content": "Still in the early stages of the course but so far I have learned a lot.
