As I said above, he covers only the aspects of each tech needed to serve the purpose of the course, which is to build an Angular front-end, serve said front-end with a Node.js backend + Express middleware, read and write to a mongodb, and deploy the application. He does offer courses for Node and Angular that are fantastic! I strongly recommend going through those first if you want the comprehensive understnading.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 7775862, "content": "i really like the way Max teaches, ty for your time.", "rating": 4.0, "created": "2017-06-26T11:52:04-07:00", "modified": "2017-07-13T06:39:09-07:00", "user_modified": "2017-07-13T06:39:09-07:00", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 27471838, "title": "Fabio Ramirez", "name": "Fabio", "display_name": "Fabio Ramirez", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "FR"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>i really like the way Max teaches, ty for your time.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 5481114, "content": "awesome class. appreciate the section on reviewing the setup.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2017-02-14T07:36:33-08:00", "modified": "2017-02-14T15:36:33-08:00", "user_modified": "2017-02-14T15:36:33-08:00", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 211598, "title": "Fareez Ahmed", "name": "Fareez", "display_name": "Fareez Ahmed", "image_50x50": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/211598_04b1_3.jpg?secure=Y5CdoykLgZGXF7UW0VUXDA%3D%3D%2C1636936613", "initials": "FA"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>awesome class. appreciate the section on reviewing the setup.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 47773496, "content": "one word I would like to say \"WOW !!!!\"", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2020-03-20T09:06:25-07:00", "modified": "2020-03-20T19:10:17-07:00", "user_modified": "2020-03-20T09:06:46-07:00", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 104533166, "title": "Easwar Sah P R", "name": "Easwar Sah", "display_name": "Easwar Sah P R", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "EP"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>one word I would like to say \"WOW !!!!\"</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 8527302, "content": "It covers a lot of ground.

To be clear, you did not pay us for a course, we paid you, and we have the right to disagree with the content and be unhappy with the purchase.

We are here to buy a product, which we hope to enjoy and use, and when we don't we voice our concerns and/or get a refund.  We do not post reviews to hold your hand and stroke your ego, we post our opinions on the value of the course as we see fit (short version of my experience: I have over 100 courses, this is the only one I've ever left a 1 star on, take it as you like).  My opinion, is that I do not see a value to this class, or why you think it is a refresher course for the MEAN stack, when it is anything but.  I will however, remember this interaction in the future when I'm asked to recommend courses.\n\n[original - cleaned up]\n\nPotential purchasers, I strongly advise you to pass on this course and take a different one - even a free one on youtube.  I'm lucky in that I'm already experienced with the MEAN stack (and its Angular and Node components) and was hoping for a MEAN refresher.  This course is not the one you want.  It doesn't cover the MEAN stack, nor does it show you how to use/setup or deploy using it.  It, in fact, has nothing to do with the MEAN stack at all outside of showing you small parts of the MEAN framework at a high level.  For some reason, it does go into how to partially install some of them individually outside of the MEAN stack, but those instructions are incomplete in of themselves and the remaining content doesn't go any deeper than glazing over his created own seed project.  Your fuzzy memory of the MEAN stack, is more evolved, than this 'refresher' course.  In fact there are very dangerous security minded topics that are expressly overlooked and personally I would not be confident hiring someone who took this course.\n\nTo give the author a bit of credit, before every single section he tells you \"if you want to learn about this topic, you have to go somewhere else\" and explains that he will not teach you anything in the section.  This is true, and arguably reflective of the entire course.  This may be acceptable for a $10 course, or if you spent your money to purchase his seed project - but you did not.\n\nClosing Summary:\nThis is not a MEAN stack course.  It does NOT refresh you on the MEAN stack itself, MEAN installation, what MEAN really is, or how to work with it.  It is a small summary over some of the MEAN components - that is all it is.  After you finish this course, you will have learned nothing, and need to revisit another course anyways.  Ther are many better and more thorough courses on Udemy or even for free on Youtube that you should be exploring, do not bother with this at all.  This course literally serves no purpose.\n\nTip to others:\nAnytime you see a course teaching something that starts with a seed project - stay away.  Contrary to what Max says below, he doesn't walk through building the seed project.  He does walk through what he has assembled, but that is it... in fact, that is the entire course.  Seed projects are shortcuts at best, and serious liabilities at worst. By relying on this seed project, you will bring in dependencies that will break in future versions of NODE.JS and it won't match what you need.

He correctly pointed to more detailed tutorials etc if the student wanted to dive deeper but provided just the right amount of extra analysis along the way.

As the tempo currently flows it forces me to have to rewind and hit pause so often that it sometimes becomes distracting to learning.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 35714654, "content": "Amazing course, learned a lot!", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2019-08-14T01:52:11-07:00", "modified": "2019-08-14T06:04:03-07:00", "user_modified": "2019-08-14T01:52:29-07:00", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 64145104, "title": "Tzach Bonfil", "name": "Tzach", "display_name": "Tzach Bonfil", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "TB"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Amazing course, learned a lot!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 61462816, "content": "Good for beginners.", "rating": 4.5, "created": "2020-07-16T22:16:30-07:00", "modified": "2020-07-17T07:06:07-07:00", "user_modified": "2020-07-16T22:16:52-07:00", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 38286802, "title": "Senthil Kumar", "name": "Senthil", "display_name": "Senthil Kumar", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "SK"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Good for beginners.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 4343508, "content": "\u697d\u3057\u304fAngular2 + MEAN\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u5b66\u3079\u307e\u3059\uff01", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2016-12-01T04:14:18-08:00", "modified": "2017-01-02T08:17:53-08:00", "user_modified": "2017-01-02T08:17:53-08:00", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 27155948, "title": "Hiraoku Shinichi", "name": "Hiraoku", "display_name": "Hiraoku Shinichi", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "HS"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>\u697d\u3057\u304fAngular2 + MEAN\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30af\u304c\u5b66\u3079\u307e\u3059\uff01</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 28325176, "content": "He uses observables but observables are part of a different course, he should have not used it.", "rating": 3.0, "created": "2019-03-06T21:56:25-08:00", "modified": "2019-03-07T10:15:57-08:00", "user_modified": "2019-03-07T10:15:57-08:00", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 3803868, "title": "Joan Magat", "name": "Joan", "display_name": "Joan Magat", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "JM"}, "response": {"_class": "course_review_response", "id": 2539578, "content": "Observables are actually a core part of Angular and therefore absolutely belong into every course that uses Observables.
