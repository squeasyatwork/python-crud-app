Thanks for your thoughts!</p>\n\n<p>I've uploaded my videos in HD quality to Udemy, and there's not too much I can do to improve that. Have you tried other courses to see if there's an issue with your internet connection? This article might help: https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229231227-Video-Playback-Issues</p>\n\n<p>I do see that you progressed all the way through the course. Sorry that it didn't meet your expectations with regards to depth. While I didn't take a deep dive into every topic Chrome Developer Tools related, I did cover a lot of things that professional web developers in my office did not know. </p>\n\n<p>I'll see what I can do to improve the depth of the course. Feel free to send me a message if there's something that you would have liked to have seen in more detail. Maybe there's an opportunity for me to do an advanced course.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, "content_html": "<p>Videos keep blurring and refocusing every 5 seconds.
