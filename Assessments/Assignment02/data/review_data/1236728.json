Finally, at each stage, that is, at the end of all this work done with each concept, all this knowledge is applied on a practical project that gets improved on each iteration.  Then, the course proceeds to a more complex concept, in a logical structure.  \n\nThe pace may seem a bit slow, but it's part of the teaching strategy, and I think it works extremely well in the context of this course's structure, at least judging by the amazing progress I've been making: everything sinks in in the end!
