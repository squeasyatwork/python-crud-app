This course is massive, he is constantly adding things to it, but its exactly what I needed to both learn PHP and be able to use it with confidence.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 3282648, "content": "A great course for beginners. \n\nBut there are times where best approach towards the solution were not taken or the solution was half baked, not fully tested.", "rating": 4.0, "created": "2016-08-30T19:52:48Z", "modified": "2016-08-31T02:52:48Z", "user_modified": "2016-08-31T02:52:48Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 24263980, "title": "Sushil Prasai", "name": "Sushil", "display_name": "Sushil Prasai", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "SP"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>A great course for beginners. </p>\n\n<p>But there are times where best approach towards the solution were not taken or the solution was half baked, not fully tested.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "5 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 52450522, "content": "Its generally a good course but frustrating when some changes are made in the coding without proper instructions/follow up", "rating": 3.5, "created": "2020-04-24T09:01:38Z", "modified": "2020-04-24T19:05:33Z", "user_modified": "2020-04-24T09:03:50Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 35781740, "title": "Rogers Mudibo", "name": "Rogers", "display_name": "Rogers Mudibo", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "RM"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Its generally a good course but frustrating when some changes are made in the coding without proper instructions/follow up</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 15493228, "content": "I've since purchased another course from Edwin (Laravel) because I like his teaching style.

Unlike other classes,  this class is not abandoned. There is an active discussion on the right hand side where students help each other out and Edwin is there to help if you get stuck.  FINALLY, there are new lectures constantly being added.  If you take one of Edwin's courses, you will probably want to take them all.   </p>\n\n<p>I have noticed a few complaints that this class isn't Object-Oriented enough for them. He definitely teaches you how to refactor your code into objects, but if you really want to learn OOP PHP, take his course that is specifically about that.  That's where I'm heading now.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "5 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 25558748, "content": "A little repetitive at times but overall very good.

I would recommend describing the differences and some extra functions that may be similar to one another.

I would purchase more courses from Edwin.\n\nOkay so I managed 234 lectures before stopping, here's why.\n\nLiterally everything within the course worked like a charm, not always first time, but eventually I got everything how it should be (the lecture questions are VERY helpful btw). So in the end, I have a fully functioning CMS, which is what I wanted.

Really nice, but he does not explain how it works and the only thing you get is: 'If you don't understand Javascript, just do what I do. Since this is a PHP course I won't explain it and I have a great course for you about Javascript where I explain everything'. This started to annoy me after a few times.

I'm right now at section 30 and just watching for a sport and inspiration for what to do next.

This and the general lack of a clearheaded strategy lead the instructor to make any number of very basic mistakes repeatedly, and lectures become unnecessarily long as he corrects them.\n\nLess often, but still problematic, the instructor will introduce a concept and entirely forego any attempt at an explanation (one trivial but illustrative example is when he uses the \"%\" symbol as part of a query for the first time).\n\nThere is no consideration given to best practices (for example the code could be significantly drier, and there is no logic to variable naming). If a developer tried to ship code in a professional environment that looks like what's taught in this course, it would result in their firing or demotion. There are a number of problems with this course and the codebase that could be avoided with the use of a linter. If nothing else, the instructor should code with syntactic and stylistic consistency, and not leave random spacing, tabs, returns, etc., everywhere.\n\nThe CMS section of the course really goes off the rails, so much so that I decided to stop progress on this course. It could be made much more valuable if students were taught how to build it from the ground up. As it stands, we're given a fairly excessive amount of code/boilerplate templates, and a number of lectures are then devoted to cutting out large sections of files, pasting them in a new file, and including them in the original.

This and the general lack of a clearheaded strategy lead the instructor to make any number of very basic mistakes repeatedly, and lectures become unnecessarily long as he corrects them.</p>\n\n<p>Less often, but still problematic, the instructor will introduce a concept and entirely forego any attempt at an explanation (one trivial but illustrative example is when he uses the \"%\" symbol as part of a query for the first time).</p>\n\n<p>There is no consideration given to best practices (for example the code could be significantly drier, and there is no logic to variable naming). If a developer tried to ship code in a professional environment that looks like what's taught in this course, it would result in their firing or demotion. There are a number of problems with this course and the codebase that could be avoided with the use of a linter. If nothing else, the instructor should code with syntactic and stylistic consistency, and not leave random spacing, tabs, returns, etc., everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>The CMS section of the course really goes off the rails, so much so that I decided to stop progress on this course. It could be made much more valuable if students were taught how to build it from the ground up. As it stands, we're given a fairly excessive amount of code/boilerplate templates, and a number of lectures are then devoted to cutting out large sections of files, pasting them in a new file, and including them in the original.

I bought this course as a complete PHP beginner to fulfill a business need as we migrate technologies. I have taken taken and completed a few other top-rated development courses on Udemy and as they have all been excellent and greatly valuable experiences, I chose this course because it too was a best-selling and top-rated course. Unfortunately, this course was far from what the high ratings promised and I was very dissatisfied with the time and money spent on the course, which leads me to give the \"awful, not what I expected at all\u201d rating.\n\nMy greatest issue with this course is the lack of professionalism and organization displayed by the instructor. His lectures aren\u2019t well prepared and feel like they were recorded on a whim. For the level of experience that he professes to have, his code is riddled with many basic errors and typos which quickly becomes really distracting as a large portion of this course is him going back to troubleshoot fundamental errors. Yes, debugging comes with the territory, but the sheer amount of errors and how easily Edwin could have avoided them may make students lose confidence in his mastery of the course material. Like many other reviews have said, it would have been much easier to follow if he had rerecorded and replaced the many lectures containing the mistakes.\n\nThere is also a profound lack of best practices that would lead to poorly written code if applied on the job. There is a lot of copy and pasting, repeating large chunks of code, lack of proper indenting, a very disorganized workspace and a very strange zoom level of his code editor that makes it difficult to follow along to name a few. Following exactly as Edwin does will result in many bad habits and sloppy code.\n\nEdwin does not give detailed explanations of his code or the PHP API and students would do better by reading the official PHP documentation to understand what\u2019s going on and why. Contrary to the course title, this style of teaching will not lead to a mastery of PHP or set the student up for success, as he simply hands the student a proverbial fish, rather than teaching him or her how to fish. \n\nThe course lists object oriented programming (OOP) as one of the things you will learn through the course, but it is important to mention that the course uses procedural PHP, not OOP PHP. There is a section that provides a very brief overview of OOP, which feels more like a marketing gimmick that allows Edwin to list it as something you will learn in the course. In reality it does very little to help the student understand the depth of OOP and what it can be used for as OOP is not applied on the main project: creating the CMS. There is no explanation of how procedural PHP and OOP PHP differ, why a developer would use one over the other, or which may be the modern standard. If you are looking to learn OOP PHP, contrary to what the course description may state, you will not be learning or using that in this course.\n\nSure, Edwin is upbeat, friendly, and seeks to motivate his students to keep going, but I personally found it off-putting, especially when more than a few lectures started with Edwin reminding his students to be grateful because \"you have all of your arms and legs and still can hear and see\". This type of commentary feels out of place for a development course and in the worst cases, unnecessarily extended the length of the lectures.\n\nAt the time of writing, I have completed 22 sections with a total of 205 lectures, but will be abandoning this as my primary PHP education source. To be perfectly honest, I was mislead by the amount of high reviews and would recommend any would-be students to carefully read through not only the four and five-star reviews, but also the one and two-star reviews to see if this may be right for you.

I bought this course as a complete PHP beginner to fulfill a business need as we migrate technologies. I have taken taken and completed a few other top-rated development courses on Udemy and as they have all been excellent and greatly valuable experiences, I chose this course because it too was a best-selling and top-rated course. Unfortunately, this course was far from what the high ratings promised and I was very dissatisfied with the time and money spent on the course, which leads me to give the \"awful, not what I expected at all\u201d rating.</p>\n\n<p>My greatest issue with this course is the lack of professionalism and organization displayed by the instructor. His lectures aren\u2019t well prepared and feel like they were recorded on a whim. For the level of experience that he professes to have, his code is riddled with many basic errors and typos which quickly becomes really distracting as a large portion of this course is him going back to troubleshoot fundamental errors. Yes, debugging comes with the territory, but the sheer amount of errors and how easily Edwin could have avoided them may make students lose confidence in his mastery of the course material. Like many other reviews have said, it would have been much easier to follow if he had rerecorded and replaced the many lectures containing the mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>There is also a profound lack of best practices that would lead to poorly written code if applied on the job. There is a lot of copy and pasting, repeating large chunks of code, lack of proper indenting, a very disorganized workspace and a very strange zoom level of his code editor that makes it difficult to follow along to name a few. Following exactly as Edwin does will result in many bad habits and sloppy code.</p>\n\n<p>Edwin does not give detailed explanations of his code or the PHP API and students would do better by reading the official PHP documentation to understand what\u2019s going on and why. Contrary to the course title, this style of teaching will not lead to a mastery of PHP or set the student up for success, as he simply hands the student a proverbial fish, rather than teaching him or her how to fish. </p>\n\n<p>The course lists object oriented programming (OOP) as one of the things you will learn through the course, but it is important to mention that the course uses procedural PHP, not OOP PHP. There is a section that provides a very brief overview of OOP, which feels more like a marketing gimmick that allows Edwin to list it as something you will learn in the course. In reality it does very little to help the student understand the depth of OOP and what it can be used for as OOP is not applied on the main project: creating the CMS. There is no explanation of how procedural PHP and OOP PHP differ, why a developer would use one over the other, or which may be the modern standard. If you are looking to learn OOP PHP, contrary to what the course description may state, you will not be learning or using that in this course.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, Edwin is upbeat, friendly, and seeks to motivate his students to keep going, but I personally found it off-putting, especially when more than a few lectures started with Edwin reminding his students to be grateful because \"you have all of your arms and legs and still can hear and see\". This type of commentary feels out of place for a development course and in the worst cases, unnecessarily extended the length of the lectures.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of writing, I have completed 22 sections with a total of 205 lectures, but will be abandoning this as my primary PHP education source. To be perfectly honest, I was mislead by the amount of high reviews and would recommend any would-be students to carefully read through not only the four and five-star reviews, but also the one and two-star reviews to see if this may be right for you. In all fairness, I did learn a lot as a result of taking this course and have comfortably moved past beginner level, but most of the learning came through the official PHP documentation and other outside sources to supplement the course material. However, I am unable to recommend this course to anyone due to all the short comings of this course.

What I've seen in different courses it's that people just attach their code on every lesson, and it's easier that way to follow up. And as for second thing I'd change, and maybe it's not that important, but I found it a bit annoying is that there are too much blank spaces in code.

I mean I know that's something everyone is doing their way, but it's really making it harder to read your code sometimes. Anyways I don't want to be harsh or anything, I really appreciate this course and I think that's really the best one out there, hope my \"constructive criticism\" was the most \"constructive\" it could be, have a great day and if I'll ever need to learn something else about PHP I'll certainly come back. :)</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "11 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 93088410, "content": "I had to look up online how to install xampp", "rating": 2.0, "created": "2021-08-16T21:36:50Z", "modified": "2021-08-17T16:03:55Z", "user_modified": "2021-08-16T21:37:07Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 48771446, "title": "Tal Sagi", "name": "Tal", "display_name": "Tal Sagi", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "TS"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>I had to look up online how to install xampp</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a month ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 73624798, "content": "Instructor makes a lot of errors and toggles rapidly between screens (I have to look at the top to see what screen he is on as he jumps in split seconds, so I pause frequently) so the student cannot follow.

This helps a lot!\n- Edwin keeps adding new things to the course, corrects outdated lectures and is actively engaged in conversation and feedback with his students in the Q&A section.\n- The course also contains a few lectures on JS, JQuery and Bootstrap which is a nice little bonus on top of everything else.\n\nCons:\n- The course has a bit too many videos about editing existing HTML templates downloaded from the course ressource files, particularly in the beginning.

While I do understand the procedural approach of the course, it does seem strange to have lectures about modularising and condensing code into functions only to then kind of forgetting about it.\n- Some videos and explanations still needs updating despite Edwin revisiting regularly. Nothing too annoying or off putting though.\n\nOverall I find this course very good and would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn PHP.

I like and appreciate Edwin as a teacher and this is one star worth.\n\nNow to this course: This course is 6 years old and outdated: It does not show best practices from today! Yes, Edwin adds \"Edwin from the future\"-Videos every time something really important changes and yes je uses valid code such as mysqli and it is important you know about its existence.\n\nBut that's not best practice anymore for several years already! Today pdo is the recommended way for database communication. Plus: It is time consuming to make things the old way just to change it to some newer stuff in the next video.\n\nUdemy sadly encourages teacher to update old courses into oblivion instead of encouraging them to make a newer up to date best practices version. On Udemy it is more important to teachers to have hundreds of sales on their course to sell more and Udemy itself hides well WHEN a course was LAUNCHED... just telling the buyer when it was updated. This is a big problem for all Udemys tech courses... more than half the web technology courses I visited so far are kind of outdated and therefore I almost stopped completely to buy them! Web techniques change so fast and after about 2 years best practices are totally different.\n\nThis course could be really great with a a complete makeover where all the \"newer\" (already years old by now) future Edwins would be packed into the regular stream of information.\nI wrote Edwin this 2 weeks ago in private and not just put it here as a complaint. Though he always responded to my questions about course topics, he did not answer this - seems he does not want to hear about his course being outdated.\n\nThis is how I wanted to learn php: I started programming in october 2018 with this course. And I understood the basics well enough. But I missed smaller exercises to train the basics. I did not make the step to start following along the cms... cause I felt I need more basics exercise. I bought another course with 24+ small exercises from another teacher here on Udemy and learned basic procedural php really well there.\n\nBeginn of this year I came back to go ahead with Edwins cms. But meanwhile I learned some things and suddenly this course seems outdated of best practices. Plus: programming a cms procedural might train you php... but you are never going to use it. Procedural is hard to maintenance and hard to bugfix. I am not going to invested the time to program something in so many hours I am not going to use.\n\nI switched to Edwins OOP - building a photo gallery course instead. I bought it together with this one and there again: msqli instead of pdo - outdated! In the questions and answers several students asked him to add pdo... Edwin answered he thought it to be too difficult for his students BUT still he said to put it on his todo list... those posts are about 4 month old! Meanwhile he asked what course to do next, but did not add pdo to this course.\n\nPDO might be a bit more complex compared to msqli but it makes database communication way saver! My guess is, pdo is not too difficult for us to learn but for Edwin to adapt his courses to.\n\nI finished 25% of this course - all basics and several cms videos. I stopped then cause my time is too valuable to spend it on outdated stuff. I am really disappointed about this course and cannot recommend it. This courses cms is just a selling point for newbies: noone needs a procedural php cms anyway!\n\nFrom today point of view this and the OOP course was a total waste of money and time.\n\nI learned OOP from another teacher as well - he uses best practices such as pdo and as well design patterns such as Model View Controller (MVC). This is the modern stuff you really need to know. Sadly for most ppl is that this course is only available in German. Thanks to Udemy not encouraging new courses on well published topics there seems to be a big lag about modern php.\nMeanwhile I advanced to the php framework Laravel. I am busy rebuilding my 15 years old really big web application with oop php, best practice design patterns and a a modern framework on my own - all learned outside this course. I am as well not buying any other courses from Edwin, fearing those might be outdated as well.\nThough I do not want to deny... my very first steps in php I made here and had quite some fun with it! Plus Edwin gave me the confidence that I will be able to learn php. My big thanks for this!\n\nI am sorry to give Edwin a bad review. And I am sorry for him that he sticks to what he has so hard instead of taking his experience as a teacher with all those questions he got and answered in his course and make a splendid new course. With investing a bit of his time and experience he could be saving hundreds of hour of lifetime for his students and teach them all the up to date stuff. And I am sure he will make good money out of a new course.\n\nHe is a good teacher and I surely knows all the good new stuff!", "rating": 1.0, "created": "2018-10-29T00:17:23Z", "modified": "2019-03-14T02:28:59Z", "user_modified": "2019-03-14T02:28:59Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 57080288, "title": "Tanja Fr\u00f6hlich", "name": "Tanja", "display_name": "Tanja Fr\u00f6hlich", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/57080288_3a17_3.jpg", "initials": "TF"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>First of all Edwin is a great teacher: He has a friendly character, is very motivating and he really knows what is takes you to really start learning this stuff. I like and appreciate Edwin as a teacher and this is one star worth.</p>\n\n<p>Now to this course: This course is 6 years old and outdated: It does not show best practices from today! Yes, Edwin adds \"Edwin from the future\"-Videos every time something really important changes and yes je uses valid code such as mysqli and it is important you know about its existence.</p>\n\n<p>But that's not best practice anymore for several years already! Today pdo is the recommended way for database communication. Plus: It is time consuming to make things the old way just to change it to some newer stuff in the next video.</p>\n\n<p>Udemy sadly encourages teacher to update old courses into oblivion instead of encouraging them to make a newer up to date best practices version. On Udemy it is more important to teachers to have hundreds of sales on their course to sell more and Udemy itself hides well WHEN a course was LAUNCHED... just telling the buyer when it was updated. This is a big problem for all Udemys tech courses... more than half the web technology courses I visited so far are kind of outdated and therefore I almost stopped completely to buy them! Web techniques change so fast and after about 2 years best practices are totally different.</p>\n\n<p>This course could be really great with a a complete makeover where all the \"newer\" (already years old by now) future Edwins would be packed into the regular stream of information.<br>I wrote Edwin this 2 weeks ago in private and not just put it here as a complaint.
