The question which I can answer is the question which is related to the course Scope. So if this course is for beginners and you ask me questions related to the JSTL library which is out of the scope, I should not answer this question or at least I can mark it as a lower priority. I am really wondering how this course is not very much informative, this course is 14.5 hours and target beginners and by end of this course the beginner developer will be able to develop a complete ADF application, which means I covered all ADF lifecycles. If you looking for more Advanced topics you can check the Advanced ADF Course which is 18.5 hours. No course will cover everything, the courses open the door for you and help you to go inside a new world and then you should go ahead searching and trying.\nThanks.", "created": "2019-10-11T14:28:29Z", "modified": "2019-10-11T14:28:29Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 26729562, "title": "Sameh Nassar", "name": "Sameh", "display_name": "Sameh Nassar", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/26729562_139e.jpg", "initials": "SN"}, "content_html": "<p>Hi,<br>This course is for beginners, not Advanced course.
