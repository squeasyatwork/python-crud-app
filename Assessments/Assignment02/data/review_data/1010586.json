Brad is the best instructor I've taken lessons with. He takes great deal of time extensively breaking down the core concepts and why they are being incorporated before even getting close to the bigger project.\n\nAlso, Rather than focusing on diving into the css files to start defining the base design and best practices, he instead focuses on WordPress functionality. Again, those are going to come into play but designing isn't what I needed to learn. For the future theme project I am going to build; I needed to learn the codex, Brad does that. From what I can see, he is going to take us through each step of building the theme file structure before we start any css design and layout. I can tell that by the time I'm done with this course. I'll finally have the understanding I needed to custom develop. Evcen what I've learned already, I could do more than I ever had in the past in order to add the functionality  I needed.\n\nIf you wanted to ever get away from the typical tuts teaching css and actual php WP codex.

Not that it isn't covered, but this is about coding and developing to build a site from scratch and the course I've been in search of all along.   </p>\n\n<p>Out of all the WordPress Development courses I have tried, even one that I really enjoy. Brad is the best instructor I've taken lessons with. He takes great deal of time extensively breaking down the core concepts and why they are being incorporated before even getting close to the bigger project.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Rather than focusing on diving into the css files to start defining the base design and best practices, he instead focuses on WordPress functionality. Again, those are going to come into play but designing isn't what I needed to learn. For the future theme project I am going to build; I needed to learn the codex, Brad does that. From what I can see, he is going to take us through each step of building the theme file structure before we start any css design and layout. I can tell that by the time I'm done with this course. I'll finally have the understanding I needed to custom develop. Evcen what I've learned already, I could do more than I ever had in the past in order to add the functionality  I needed.</p>\n\n<p>If you wanted to ever get away from the typical tuts teaching css and actual php WP codex. You'll want this course. I couldn't be more happy with his teaching style.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 36619090, "content": "Very good, a ton of content", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2019-08-31T13:34:38Z", "modified": "2019-08-31T19:05:28Z", "user_modified": "2019-08-31T13:34:50Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 36372600, "title": "Michael Spinks", "name": "Michael", "display_name": "Michael Spinks", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "MS"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Very good, a ton of content</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 42091612, "content": "It was a great course.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2019-12-17T10:29:47Z", "modified": "2019-12-17T18:04:11Z", "user_modified": "2019-12-17T10:31:12Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 97272704, "title": "Mohd.

I know about Gulp and I build my themes from scratch. I do like to learn new methods or newer ways to keep up or to expand my approach. Brad is a very good teacher. He explains every step very clearly. There's no argument there. However, there are some things that need to be said. If you have questions, you have to wait a while to get an answer. A while means weeks. Secondly, you need to go through every video. All the information is related. I was particularly interested in the WP Rest details and also the deployment. I skipped right to it and it didn't make much sense to me so I found myself going through the videos on how Brad set up the custom post types. So, the good thing about this whole course is I did learn some new methods and Brad is a good teacher if you haven't had the experience. The negative is that at times it seems a bit much, the code seemed a bit wonky - because when I tried it out (the exact same way), it didn't work and I got a bunch of errors. I wasn't the only one - the Q&A's were full of it.

He explains every step very clearly. There's no argument there. However, there are some things that need to be said. If you have questions, you have to wait a while to get an answer. A while means weeks. Secondly, you need to go through every video. All the information is related. I was particularly interested in the WP Rest details and also the deployment. I skipped right to it and it didn't make much sense to me so I found myself going through the videos on how Brad set up the custom post types.

Its the first course what actually walks out of the basic theme and covers really confusing topics. Actually I am surprised on how easy it is to follow. Also the guy has a very likeable voice and the pace is really comfortable. I was able to complete 1-2 hour long sessions without getting bored to death.. :)\n\nThe only note so far and I am at 60% is that I would like to have a section or at least 1 video on how to create custom fields without custom field plugin. The hard way..  Would be very helpful to know it especially if you dont want your client to mess around in admin panel and for example delete the plugin what will bring the whole site down.. To me this seems dangerous to rely solely on a plugin to power half of your custom code.\n\nISSUES: I have ran into issues what had to do with configuration of Virtual box and my gulp watch didn't work properly at the beginning however I got it all going eventually. \n\nI would suggest to use AMPPS for this course since its easy to create the .test domain without the need of manually editing the hosts file etc. Virtual box and vagrant is a bit confusing especially for any one who just starts in development. \n\nAll in all this IMHO is one of the best wordpress courses.
