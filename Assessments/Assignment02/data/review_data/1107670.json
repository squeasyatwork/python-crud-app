At least in Udemy (at the time of writing this review) there is no course to teach you what you will learn here.

Thank you.\n\n\nOLD REVIEW:\nI emphasize that I bought this course and did not get it for free.\nI could not advance in the course more than 50% because it is not made for ruby \u200b\u200bon rails 5+. Not only that it is made with booststrap 3 and in ror +5 you use bootstrap 4. Although the instructor in one of the questions provides the version of the template for boostrap 4, the javascript code does not work as presented in the lessons.\nI spent a lot of time trying to adapt the code, spent hours to make something work that the video explained in 10 minutes. Very disappointing for the waste of time. The course promises to be very good... It should only be updated.\nI know this review is hard, but it is because the course as it is on this date (September 19, 2019) is unusable for those of us who are learning. And after all, those of us who are learning are the ones who buy these courses.\nWhen the instructor updates the course I will give him another chance.
