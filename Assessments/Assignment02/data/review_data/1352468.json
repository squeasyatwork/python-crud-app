My expectation is that this is a prerequisite for building microservices. Also, for the simplicity of the demo, some bad practices were presented and it wasn't mentioned that they should be avoided. If you are absolutely novice to the Spring and need 4h of tutorials to build a simple REST service + JPA persistence then things like proper constructor DI, DTOs and separation of concerns between the layers should be explained.\nHowever, the second part of the course is worth the time and money invested. The author provides simple and understandable examples for a variety of technologies related to microservices best practices. It is an amazing video tutorial.

It was definitely good course, but a little bit uneven. I understand that technology is changing everyday and course must be updated, but adding both old and new materials to the same course do not seems like a good idea. To be able to finish course one need to go through all lectures, even for just seeing last 10 sec, to mark it as viewed. Also I think part on basic Java is not needed here, as there are similar (if not the same) course on the subject from in28minutes.\nI really enjoyed microservices and docker part, and would love to see/learn more about Kubernetes, but it was already over 3 hours long so probably that was the reason. I saw a lot of added notes as a separate lectures, just to point that next video is not valid anymore. I would really expect that video lecture will be re-recorded with updated content, especially as most video are like 5 minutes long. I hope my feedback will help improve this already good course.
