A lot of the Q&A is students asking why something is not working which is also somewhat good because you have to go out of your way to find the information yourself and student do usually help each other which is a good thing to see as the students are all quite helpful towards each other.</p>\n\n<p>The teaching assistance is a bit condescending towards students as well and is not very active I see some posts with no reply from 6 months ago and some posts from a month ago telling them to find the answer on another post.  I also saw a student say when the course will be updated to Angular 10 and the TA said basically to the student \"That they can go create their own course\" don't know why they're a teaching assistant if they don't want to help? </p>\n\n<p>Overall, maybe in 2016/2017, this would have been the go-to Angular course on Udemy but by today's standards, there are much better courses out there.  I am pretty disappointed by this course 2/5</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 18114564, "content": "Yes, Course and presentation is impressive", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2018-06-27T18:23:24Z", "modified": "2020-05-13T17:41:37Z", "user_modified": "2020-05-13T17:41:37Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 35294262, "title": "Natarajan", "name": "Natarajan", "display_name": "Natarajan", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "N"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Yes, Course and presentation is impressive</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 93079828, "content": "I like the way He teaches.

Knowledge communication through examples and a small exercise after every topic were the key things which made the learning smooth. On what can be improved, I would want the courses to be updated with the new Angular version changes. As the course was build on older version of angular, certain libraries/dependencies are no more available with the new version, we have to look for an alternative for those dependencies. Having said this the changes from old to new version weren't huge but it will be of a benefit.
