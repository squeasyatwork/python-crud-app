This course apparently is the best PWA course ever out there, it is an excellent/outstading course that teach you all the advanced features of PWA. \n\nAlthough PWA means progressive web app, but with the help of the advanced API we can turn web app into native app with just a few lines of codes. This is not what you can find in other courses.\nThe instructor is very professional, he explains pretty well, the examples are great. I especially like the chapters that teach us all the methods that download front end files into our device caches step by step, I am amazed that I don't need to add all the files and service worker automatically fetches web app from server and install in our device at the very first beginning. and that's done, no need to write single page application if you use this strategy, making  life so much easier, thank you Mr. Viljoin for the awesome course!!!", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2019-02-24T16:53:53Z", "modified": "2019-02-25T10:02:00Z", "user_modified": "2019-02-24T17:05:49Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 29506438, "title": "Stephen Lai", "name": "Stephen", "display_name": "Stephen Lai", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/29506438_d63f_2.jpg", "initials": "SL"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>I purchased this course long time ago, like a year ago, until now I write comment on this course.
