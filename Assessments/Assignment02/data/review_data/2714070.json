This course is to make people understand how to visualize the Stocks and Currency data using Highstocks chart in Angular application. In this course I am not teaching how to write Angular code with OOP concepts or using different operators of RxJS etc. The prerequisites  of this course is you should be good in Angular. Every developer has its own way to write the best code as per their application requirements and use different operators of RxJS. So the major focus is Highstocks integration and not Angular. Still I am really sorry to hear that this course did not reach your expectation.
