This means the default Apollo Installation will not work with his code, and most online documentation is worthless.

The best I have come across that tackles GraphQL. Mr Nasato has done a great job here. I'm surprised that there aren't that many courses by him. Language and sound were perfectly clear, though the tone was slightly monotonous, but it did not affect the great explanations. <br>I've been trying to pickup GraphQL for a while now but resources were limited and some were not good enough. This course has hit its target right on for me, and actually made GraphQL a lot easier to learn. Very highly recommended to anyone wanting to learn GraphQL, though a good knowledge of JavaScript, Node, some react, and API development in general will make this course much more useful and easier to follow.<br>Finally, it would be very useful to add to the course a section that explains the use of Query/Mutations components  from Apollo Client in react.
