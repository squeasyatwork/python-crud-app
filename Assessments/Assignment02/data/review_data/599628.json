I must say that everything I needed to learn was clearly and simply demonstrated and taught in this course! After completing the course, I ran into a problem with FTP. I went online and all the usual places like forums, even the vestaCP forum, but got no help or answer. So I approached the author Riyad Arefin with my problem. He was swift to respond with my solution and help me solve my problem. So I have to recommend this course for anyone who wants to manage a VPS server. This course was truly helpful.
