While he explains how to install node (which I already had installed), he doesn't cover installing React.  He does have a file that tells you how to install some components that work with React, but he doesn't cover React installation at all. \n\nThe IDE of choice is VisualStudio and I'm pretty tired of seeing instructors default to that.

VS can't load a directory of code like Webstorm/IntelliJ.
