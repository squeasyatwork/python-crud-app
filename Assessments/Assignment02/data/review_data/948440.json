I just finished 4-30, and the html<br>     <div class=\"inline images\"> <br>caused some major problems for me. <br>.images was referenced earlier, and had a float of right, which made the icon images sit outside the container. I removed images, and all is well.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier in the course, there is no real explanation on how the code he says to do is able to mask the phone image and the background image.</p>\n\n<p>I finished the course. A lot of it was review for me, and that is still valuable.<br>However, I did not appreciate a few things:<br>-Freeze framing and putting in text explanations to cover mistakes. But I do get it. I have a YT channel with lots of videos too.<br>-Bonus lectures not finished. However, It does provide a challenge for me to finish what we started.<br>-Your video about positioning says that the parent needs to be relative, and children set to absolute. By that logic, .imgs should have been relative.<br>I had to go back and rewatch what you actually did in order to determine that .imgs was still set to abs.<br>-There was a lot of video padding. Introducing, and welcoming.... blah blah blah. Get to the meat!</p>\n\n<p>Outside of that, I enjoyed the course. It's nice to have another process to learn from.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 34632140, "content": "Good, easy understand", "rating": 4.5, "created": "2019-07-22T19:38:06Z", "modified": "2019-07-29T06:44:51Z", "user_modified": "2019-07-29T06:44:51Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 68550654, "title": "Office @ Creative Internet", "name": "Office", "display_name": "Office @ Creative Internet", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "O@"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Good, easy understand</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 10659034, "content": "still not see what I m looking but way of explanation is good", "rating": 4.0, "created": "2017-10-31T13:04:29Z", "modified": "2018-05-22T15:18:00Z", "user_modified": "2017-11-03T13:07:29Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 32391284, "title": "Anis Ahmed", "name": "Anis", "display_name": "Anis Ahmed", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "AA"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>still not see what I m looking but way of explanation is good</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 24703588, "content": "This is a great course.
