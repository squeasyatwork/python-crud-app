I've been studying Javascript for about 6 months and I have been building websites with React, but I wanted to learn more about how to use vanilla javascript to make things happen directly on the DOM. This course is perfect because you are introduced to all those methods that help you make things happen with the elements on the page using vanilla javascript, and you get tons of practice opportunities that challenge you to figure out how to make things work. I feel like I have a much better understanding of how Javascript can directly manipulate the elements in the browser, and since I know React, I know understand a bit more about what is going on under the hood with React. I'll definitely be buying more of the instructor's courses in the future.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2019-08-25T17:05:57Z", "modified": "2019-08-26T08:03:57Z", "user_modified": "2019-08-25T17:10:00Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 44020990, "title": "Sandra Rodgers", "name": "Sandra", "display_name": "Sandra Rodgers", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "SR"}, "response": {"_class": "course_review_response", "id": 3210464, "content": "Thank you for the wonderful review and feedback - glad you enjoyed the course best wishes", "created": "2019-08-26T08:39:25Z", "modified": "2019-08-26T08:39:25Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 5581552, "title": "Laurence Svekis", "name": "Laurence", "display_name": "Laurence Svekis", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/5581552_b409_23.jpg", "initials": "LS"}, "content_html": "<p>Thank you for the wonderful review and feedback - glad you enjoyed the course best wishes</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, "content_html": "<p>This course is extremely helpful.
