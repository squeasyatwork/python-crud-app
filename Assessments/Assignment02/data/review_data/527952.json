I am not a professional developer and before this course I had some very basic PHP knowledge...I also learned a lot of the basics throughout this course (with my additional research).  \n\nTo be honest, I wasn't expecting such a nice experience. I love the short lectures, which are very well structured, in such a way that you can understand each step little by little. Edwin's explanations are pretty clear most of the time, the rhythm of coding is perfect, not too slow but not too fast either. Of course, you can always pause or rewind parts of the video. Every functionality of this application is super nice and the logic behind them is very clear. In the end, I had everything working just fine.\n\nAnother thing: I LOVE that you can see when the teacher makes some mistakes himself! He kind of gives you tricks how to debug your code faster and you also learn from his mistakes.\n\nAlso, I was surprised to discover that anytime I had a question or some problem regarding the code, the team behind this course was very nice and helpful. I always received an answer pretty fast. Of course, maybe not all of them were clear solutions, but still they helped me figure out what the problem was. You still can't expect someone else to debug your code all the time! So, I have a lot of appreciation to the team/the person that managed all the questions from the students, I think they are doing a great job.\n\nThank you!!", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2020-03-19T10:15:42Z", "modified": "2020-06-23T12:39:47Z", "user_modified": "2020-06-23T12:39:47Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 99513390, "title": "M.

I am not a professional developer and before this course I had some very basic PHP knowledge...I also learned a lot of the basics throughout this course (with my additional research).  </p>\n\n<p>To be honest, I wasn't expecting such a nice experience. I love the short lectures, which are very well structured, in such a way that you can understand each step little by little. Edwin's explanations are pretty clear most of the time, the rhythm of coding is perfect, not too slow but not too fast either. Of course, you can always pause or rewind parts of the video. Every functionality of this application is super nice and the logic behind them is very clear. In the end, I had everything working just fine.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing: I LOVE that you can see when the teacher makes some mistakes himself! He kind of gives you tricks how to debug your code faster and you also learn from his mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I was surprised to discover that anytime I had a question or some problem regarding the code, the team behind this course was very nice and helpful. I always received an answer pretty fast. Of course, maybe not all of them were clear solutions, but still they helped me figure out what the problem was. You still can't expect someone else to debug your code all the time!
