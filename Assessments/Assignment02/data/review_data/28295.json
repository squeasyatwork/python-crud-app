You will code a website in 4 hours. That is, however, very different from saying you will LEARN TO code a website in 4 hours.\n\nFar too many lines and concepts go unexplained, and I got increasingly annoyed with the constant \"I will not dive into this\" comments from the instructor when forced to add a piece of \"CSS trickery\" he did not seem to want to introduce. That gives me the impression the course was not carefully planned in advance, and he was just improvising as he went along with no clear progression - a feeling I had throughout the entire course. \n\nEven more confusingly, the instructor often spends time explaining the very basic and blatantly obvious, only to later skip clarifying the slightly more complex, in an apparent contradiction to the course\u2019s stated minimum required skills. If a concept being utilised (such as \u201cclearfix\") plays such a central role in the design, I would expect it to have its use at least defined.\n\nMostly, it just felt like long sessions of switching between the video and my code editor to mechanically copy the code that was being written, with little to no explanation or clarification of why, as well as being directed to third-party web resources to read \"if you wish to know more\u201d. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I did extract some good learning from this course, and there is value in following along. However, learning any language - not just computer language - requires more than just writing words without knowing their meaning or reasons behind it, lest the learning runs the risk of becoming a fixed mental model that is not adaptable or replicable. I expect an instructor to guide me progressively through the topics, so later I will feel competent enough to replicate my learning on my own. I am sorry to say, I don\u2019t in this case.\n\nThe course is thus not recommended for beginners, and those with a little experience might feel slightly bored. Well presented, however, some good tips and good voice and production, and inspires you to seek to learn more.

You will code a website in 4 hours. That is, however, very different from saying you will LEARN TO code a website in 4 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Far too many lines and concepts go unexplained, and I got increasingly annoyed with the constant \"I will not dive into this\" comments from the instructor when forced to add a piece of \"CSS trickery\" he did not seem to want to introduce. That gives me the impression the course was not carefully planned in advance, and he was just improvising as he went along with no clear progression - a feeling I had throughout the entire course. </p>\n\n<p>Even more confusingly, the instructor often spends time explaining the very basic and blatantly obvious, only to later skip clarifying the slightly more complex, in an apparent contradiction to the course\u2019s stated minimum required skills. If a concept being utilised (such as \u201cclearfix\") plays such a central role in the design, I would expect it to have its use at least defined.</p>\n\n<p>Mostly, it just felt like long sessions of switching between the video and my code editor to mechanically copy the code that was being written, with little to no explanation or clarification of why, as well as being directed to third-party web resources to read \"if you wish to know more\u201d. </p>\n\n<p>Don't get me wrong, I did extract some good learning from this course, and there is value in following along. However, learning any language - not just computer language - requires more than just writing words without knowing their meaning or reasons behind it, lest the learning runs the risk of becoming a fixed mental model that is not adaptable or replicable. I expect an instructor to guide me progressively through the topics, so later I will feel competent enough to replicate my learning on my own.

I found the pop quizzes to be good follow up to the points in the lessons. I knew based on my quiz results whether I needed to revisit some of the topics for better understanding. I am now moving on to his Bootstrap 3 course, which I'm definitely looking forward to. </p>\n\n<p>Only minor complaint (which, sadly, I find in many courses) is the use of a mic that picks up far too much of the ambient sounds in the room. Since many of us use ear buds to listen to the course, it can be a bit annoying to hear every keyboard tap / mouse click / fan hum, etc. because an omnidirectional mic was used rather than a directional aimed mainly at picking up the teacher's narration.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately Brad has a good speaking voice and style so, by comparison to another course I recently signed up for (and I won't be mean and mention here), it wasn't too distracting. The other course I couldn't even finish because the teacher wasn't organized to begin with and then constantly had lip smacks, chair squeaks, and other noises overshadowing the narration. I finally gave up on that one.</p>\n\n<p>I made it through the PSD to HTML5/CSS3 course in one evening and have reviewed a few of the videos for refreshers since.</p>\n\n<p>Excellent course!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "8 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 49226, "content": "The example project is pretty good.
