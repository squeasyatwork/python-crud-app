And to be honest, have not been really sure when someone would tell me that it would take them at least 3 days to create or change a Navbar. As a former mainframe programmer I always had quick ways of getting things done. My biggest issue was three fold; 1) My developer always blamed Bootstrap for the problems, 2) I did not know whether  Bootstrap was the issue or if my developer was at fault, and 3) I didn't know if what I was asking for was unreasonable or not.\n\nSo I came into the class prepared for some very tough going. However, Ernest has really made it easy to learn and understand Bootstrap and really made it clear on how it works.\n\nThanks Ernest, you've made me want more... Being that I've been in management for the past 20 years, I never thought I'd want to come back into coding... You've really left me wanting more. I was able to go through my developer's work and find the mistakes that were made in a very short time. Believe it or not, they were very elementary in the scheme of things. Great game changer for me as a manager.\n\nErnest is a great instructor, very knowledgeable, and his class goes through many of the things needed to get a great responsive site created... Talks a bit fast, so I'm glad I can pause the video while I try out what he demonstrated. All-in-all, I would recommend this course to anyone that wants to get a clear understanding of what it takes to get things done using Bootstrap.  I have not completed the entire class yet (80% done), but its already helped me with the issues I was facing. \n\nThanks again Ernest.\n\n- Chuck", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2017-12-23T14:14:03Z", "modified": "2018-05-22T15:19:30Z", "user_modified": "2017-12-27T09:54:39Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 19752000, "title": "Chuck Diaz", "name": "Chuck", "display_name": "Chuck Diaz", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "CD"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>I am a program manager dealing with some developers that like to drag things out.
