It would be good if he gave you a 10 second pause or said pause now and type this in, because if practice is how you learn, then you need to type what he's typing and I wasn't always sure when to pause, so I wound up going back over a lot of content to pause where he did and figure out what screen he was on.  The HTML and CSS backgrounds look the same, so you can easily wind up typing on the wrong page.  One thing that is not clear is why you type it on the HTML page, and then copy it to CSS instead of just typing on CSS Page.  What is the benefit of using CSS if the same exact steps are on the HTML page and do the exact same thing?  This was not hard, and I'm gaining confidence. I knew more than I thought, but to become a full-stack web dev. will require far more than introductory.
