For the content, yes, there are a lot of cool stuffs & Reed's courses has his own style and followers. Its not for beginners. No basics are covered ( should not be expected in a one & a half hour crash course ). Its for those people who knows Javascript, react fundamentals & a bit of node, who just wants to put those pieces together, and build up something cool under 2 hours. Is it complete? No. It can be a good base to begin with. It would have been better if there was a customer login, and populate the cart based on it. There are a few essential functionalities missing - Like remember card for future purchases, having a downloadable invoice etc which would have made this course even more awesome. I also learned new stuffs like react query, use shopping cart package etc and a full set of functionalities without redux. Overall, i loved it for a course under 1.5 hrs. Looking forward to see more functionalities added on to this in the future !", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2021-03-06T00:43:02Z", "modified": "2021-03-07T15:01:56Z", "user_modified": "2021-03-06T00:48:29Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 14332602, "title": "Hari krishnan", "name": "Hari", "display_name": "Hari krishnan", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/14332602_f476_7.jpg", "initials": "HK"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>I finished the whole course from start to finish in one go.
