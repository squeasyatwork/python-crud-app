On the plus side, I got an immersive experience of building something practical using so many different things. So, now, I don't feel that these are strange terms.

Robeen technique is simple but effective: if you didn't understand the first videos, don't worry: he will keep repeating and revising many times the same topic in further lessons so you will end up memorising concepts and routines. If you already know some OO programming in any language you will have an advantage and the sections about html, css, JavaScript and ruby will be more for reference. Robeen is very interested in providing an excellent mentoring, being generally available in the discussion board as well as working on improving the content to take you to an advanced level. (In fact, when I wrote this review the first time I gave it 4 stars, but I had to edit after more good content was added!). So: If you are a newbie in web development and your are thinking in RoR as an option, try this course FIRST! And if you didn't know anything about RoR before this course, wait to get to lesson 119: truly a turn-point!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "6 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 2774498, "content": "It explains things very well, but it is way too basic for me.

It would be much better to first spend some time explaining things and THEN go put them into practice.</p>\n\n<p>3) Content flow: The flow of the resources provided is backwards... First you follow through with the instructor's confusing train of thought and in the end there is a link to codecademy courses which are waaaaay better in terms of provided information and flow. I realised that doing these courses first and THEN watching the videos of the section, made me understand the content way better. The external resources from codecademy made the videos from that course seem so lacking, that it's funny people pay so much for the course. The instructor also often trails off to explain something minor, but takes 5-6 minutes to get back in course, which was highly annoying.

He's also great at breaking down the complex concepts and repeats those things often throughout the course. Even if you get lost, just press on and the later lectures will REALLY help you understand what's going on.\n\nAlso, Rob includes all the code and instructions lesson by lesson and even lets you download the entire source. This is invaluable. For me, it is often easier to paste code and really sit there and stare at the screen as he enters his code and explains things.  It's often too distracting if you're trying to \"keep up\" or pause the screen to fix syntax errors.  Obviously you could copy/paste and not learn a thing, but if you're willing to take the time and pay attention, you'll learn a ton.\n\nTHE BAD\nJust know that Rob will not be the one teaching you most of the coding.  The necessary homework is going to often send you to the free courses at CodeAcademy where you will spend days learning all the syntax in a very frustrating environment and you will spend a large amount of time trying to figure out why you entered proper code and it didn't work.  It sucks. Unfortunately, that's where the bulk of the Ruby learnin' actually comes from.\n\nUNDERSTAND\nYou can go to CodeAcademy and take that stuff for free without buying this course. What you're paying Rob for is his excellent step by step walkthrough on how to build a fully functioning Ruby on Rails Application.\n\nALSO UNDERSTAND\nThis course has a large expectation that you are going to use additional outside resources (sometimes at additional expense) to fully learn the important concepts this class wants you to learn.   So you will spend 25% of the total time learning from Rob, 25% of the time beating your head against a wall at Code Academy and 50% of your time going through the resources at the end of the class to get the full experience.  \n\nIs it worth it?
