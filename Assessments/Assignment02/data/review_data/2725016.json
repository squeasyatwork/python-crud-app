In reality the course is a good foundation for MVC even though that isn\u2019t the title. \n\nIf you want a foundation course on MVC then this is a great course. It is a little slow to start and becomes a bit repetitive because the example application isn\u2019t a trivial one and includes several views that essentially perform similar operations (albeit on different data or to produce different views of it).\n\nOne thing I found frustrating is that in a few places very basic aspects of C# are explained (ie what the ! does in if(!x)) but pertinent details aren\u2019t. An example being that the modelstate is glossed over without explaining it but googling it I found a good Microsoft explanation of what it is, how its produced, what it contains and what it does. Once I understood that it makes far more sense and is easily understandable. A simple slide is provided to explain scoped vs singleton vs transient but it just repeats the standard simple Microsoft explanation and isn\u2019t helpful at explaining these which are important issues and deserved a full explanation. Similarly I felt that async was glossed over but is an extremely important topic.\n\nIdentity is covered and Trevoir explains extending the base Identity to include additional fields. It\u2019s a very useful section and as with everything else covered if explained in a clear step-by-step manner. However, I really really wished it had gone further. My frustration is the course covers the basics but in many places falls into the common trap of just saying \u201cyou need to put this line of code here\u201d without explaining the details or what\u2019s actually happening within the framework. I think a weakness of the course is that it doesn\u2019t explain the security issues and just glosses over things like ValidateAntiForgeryToken. At a couple of points Trevoir uses a js onclick function but warns that it creates a security issue and therefore isn\u2019t good practice. I think at one point he says he\u2019s going to explain this but unless I missed the explanation never does so. It would have been very useful to have a section on security.\n\nThe course is billed as the \u201ccomplete\u201d source on EF development. However, I was left wanting/needing more. It covers the essentials for an app with a small database with reasonably simple queries. However, there is no explanation that .net can execute some queries in the database whereas as soon as you cast the results to other data classes any query will be executed in memory having fetched all of the underlying records from the database. If you have a table with millions of records that quickly because extremely bad. Also the course doesn\u2019t deal with only fetching limited columns to optimise performance and doesn\u2019t deal with complex queries. The course assumes the use of automapper but does not really deal with building apps without automapper.\n\nThe course is billed as the complete course for EF and whilst it is a good course in the essentials of MVC I found it very lacking in terms of covering EF except in terms of the basics for a reasonably simple MVC app.\n\nThe course doesn\u2019t cover Razor @pages (just razor views \u2013 its an MVC course) and doesn\u2019t cover partial pages (except briefly mentioning the login view) or Razor components.

In reality the course is a good foundation for MVC even though that isn\u2019t the title. </p>\n\n<p>If you want a foundation course on MVC then this is a great course. It is a little slow to start and becomes a bit repetitive because the example application isn\u2019t a trivial one and includes several views that essentially perform similar operations (albeit on different data or to produce different views of it).</p>\n\n<p>One thing I found frustrating is that in a few places very basic aspects of C# are explained (ie what the ! does in if(!x)) but pertinent details aren\u2019t. An example being that the modelstate is glossed over without explaining it but googling it I found a good Microsoft explanation of what it is, how its produced, what it contains and what it does. Once I understood that it makes far more sense and is easily understandable. A simple slide is provided to explain scoped vs singleton vs transient but it just repeats the standard simple Microsoft explanation and isn\u2019t helpful at explaining these which are important issues and deserved a full explanation. Similarly I felt that async was glossed over but is an extremely important topic.</p>\n\n<p>Identity is covered and Trevoir explains extending the base Identity to include additional fields. It\u2019s a very useful section and as with everything else covered if explained in a clear step-by-step manner. However, I really really wished it had gone further. My frustration is the course covers the basics but in many places falls into the common trap of just saying \u201cyou need to put this line of code here\u201d without explaining the details or what\u2019s actually happening within the framework. I think a weakness of the course is that it doesn\u2019t explain the security issues and just glosses over things like ValidateAntiForgeryToken. At a couple of points Trevoir uses a js onclick function but warns that it creates a security issue and therefore isn\u2019t good practice. I think at one point he says he\u2019s going to explain this but unless I missed the explanation never does so. It would have been very useful to have a section on security.</p>\n\n<p>The course is billed as the \u201ccomplete\u201d source on EF development. However, I was left wanting/needing more. It covers the essentials for an app with a small database with reasonably simple queries. However, there is no explanation that .net can execute some queries in the database whereas as soon as you cast the results to other data classes any query will be executed in memory having fetched all of the underlying records from the database. If you have a table with millions of records that quickly because extremely bad. Also the course doesn\u2019t deal with only fetching limited columns to optimise performance and doesn\u2019t deal with complex queries. The course assumes the use of automapper but does not really deal with building apps without automapper.</p>\n\n<p>The course is billed as the complete course for EF and whilst it is a good course in the essentials of MVC I found it very lacking in terms of covering EF except in terms of the basics for a reasonably simple MVC app.</p>\n\n<p>The course doesn\u2019t cover Razor @pages (just razor views \u2013 its an MVC course) and doesn\u2019t cover partial pages (except briefly mentioning the login view) or Razor components.

Very interesting.<br>- The LTE Admin implementation, the azure publish and iis impl were pretty nice.</p>\n\n<p>Improvement areas:<br>- In most videos the code through the IDE can barely be seen, hope you can zoom it in.<br>- The project structure could be shown in a more explained way: the leave allocation part could be better in order to be more understandable, i mean, some friendly messages for letting know about the assignation of days. Maybe a little more depth explanation like a user story, as detailed as the database diagram shown at the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Keep up the good work, best regards.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 65702340, "content": "The presentation, pace and course is ideal for experienced .Net developers wanting to upgrade our skills to .Net CORE.
