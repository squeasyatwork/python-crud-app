However, the section is a bit rushed and needs more intro as well as a few more steps on the setups.  If you want to learn JavaScript from the ground up, this is definitely the course to take.

BEST REVIEW COMING HERE!\n\nWell, Hello! This is a detailed review on this course. I have sat through all the lectures, practised or noted most of the lectures and this is what I have got for you guys who wants to learn JS.\n\nFirst of all, Brad is self taught expert in the Full Stack Domain and it is very clear.\nThere are both pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n1) The lectures are very tight, I think its not lengthy.\n2) Clearly mentions all the key points and \"Nothing goes unexplained\"( I will come back to this)\n3) Definitely  worth the money and time.\n4) Made for a Beginner, who wants to learn JS quickly and cover most of it.\n\nCons:\n1) There are topics where you got to sit through where Brad writes or says stuff and you have nothing to do expect to listen to him. These  are the key points. Once said, He never repeats it in most of the cases which he does so, will help a lot!\n2) The Q&A is not at all responsive! No one answers the damn questions not even Brad.( Applicable to all his courses)\n3) If the projects are not practised, Baby you have learnt nothing except Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V .\n\nThis is my guide to successfully enjoy this course.\n\nMost of the time, I make notes on the course, revise it daily.

BEST REVIEW COMING HERE!</p>\n\n<p>Well, Hello! This is a detailed review on this course. I have sat through all the lectures, practised or noted most of the lectures and this is what I have got for you guys who wants to learn JS.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, Brad is self taught expert in the Full Stack Domain and it is very clear.<br>There are both pros and cons.</p>\n\n<p>Pros:<br>1) The lectures are very tight, I think its not lengthy.<br>2) Clearly mentions all the key points and \"Nothing goes unexplained\"( I will come back to this)<br>3) Definitely  worth the money and time.<br>4) Made for a Beginner, who wants to learn JS quickly and cover most of it.</p>\n\n<p>Cons:<br>1) There are topics where you got to sit through where Brad writes or says stuff and you have nothing to do expect to listen to him. These  are the key points. Once said, He never repeats it in most of the cases which he does so, will help a lot!<br>2) The Q&A is not at all responsive! No one answers the damn questions not even Brad.( Applicable to all his courses)<br>3) If the projects are not practised, Baby you have learnt nothing except Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V .</p>\n\n<p>This is my guide to successfully enjoy this course.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the time, I make notes on the course, revise it daily.

I suppose this project had the superficial form of a state pattern but did not actually implement one.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere, there were also examples of classes that held no state and could just as well have been a collection of independent functions.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 27203420, "content": "The course is explained really well, and I have no struggles to understand the point of the lecture.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2019-02-10T13:27:26Z", "modified": "2019-04-29T05:06:14Z", "user_modified": "2019-04-29T05:06:14Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 65129304, "title": "Justas Jankauskas", "name": "Justas", "display_name": "Justas Jankauskas", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "JJ"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>The course is explained really well, and I have no struggles to understand the point of the lecture.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 58817576, "content": "This was really a great course that made me understand the possibilities of JavaScript!", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2020-06-18T10:22:02Z", "modified": "2020-09-27T00:53:28Z", "user_modified": "2020-09-27T00:53:28Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 110917590, "title": "Herman Nienhuis", "name": "Herman", "display_name": "Herman Nienhuis", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "HN"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>This was really a great course that made me understand the possibilities of JavaScript!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 61110428, "content": "the course has been great so far and support is top notch, Thanks!", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2020-07-13T09:02:39Z", "modified": "2020-09-11T08:08:00Z", "user_modified": "2020-09-11T08:08:00Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 124818672, "title": "mohamed Soliman", "name": "mohamed", "display_name": "mohamed Soliman", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "MS"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>the course has been great so far and support is top notch, Thanks!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 38377946, "content": "Voicing is easy to understand and perfectly paced for me.

I like the brisk pace, resources included, Brad's vocalization is soothing which is good for long experiences.  As I went all the way through, I really was able to appreciate the whole concept of starting with modern JS, sans frameworks.  I believe this is exactly what I needed.  I am an experienced developer, having mostly done .NET in recent years, but never ground up web development (other than assisting and following direction from a lead dev).  It is quite different.  In many ways pretty easy to follow but without the thoughtful curation Brad provides, it would be much more difficult.  I recently learned Python from not having had much of a roadmap, and it took longer to feel comfortable.  Plus, Python as I have learned it thus far has been much more similar to my previous non-web experience.

I am an experienced developer, having mostly done .NET in recent years, but never ground up web development (other than assisting and following direction from a lead dev).  It is quite different.  In many ways pretty easy to follow but without the thoughtful curation Brad provides, it would be much more difficult.

A perfect example is when he uses the splice() function on an array. He passes in the index as a second argument in order to use it in the foreach loop, but when he uses the splice() function, he says to pass in the index, and then a 1 to delete the item.

I understand that coding in real life is very much like that. Having to reference docs a quite a bit and copy/paste to save time, but for a video designed to teach people, I don't need to watch someone code something that works and hope that I get the reason for the code on the first pass through.

I have done all the lectures and so on. It is about 20 hours of course. However, it took me 43 days to complete it.   It is incredible how much we could learn from Brad. It is really amazing to see how he can teach many different topics in a really nice and easy way.\nWhat I really liked:\n1) It is a course that we really learn a lot of JavaScript! It is incredible! He does not waste any minute talking thinks that does not matter. It is 20 hours of REALLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION!! For beginners, can be a bit hard to get so many information!! It is good that you know a little of JavaScript or at least a good knowledge of html and css! If you are beginner I really advice to go step by step. Stop the lectures and do some parallel projects. \n2) The projects are very well done. We used some framework as bootstrap, skeleton and so on. I really advice you also to do parallel projects to fix the knowledge learned in this course!\n\nWhat I did not liked?\n1) I think one negative point is that Brad does not reply any message. I understand that he does not have time. So, if you have problems, you have to figure out it for yourself or wait some help from someone here. For me, it was not a problem at all. But it is a point that you have to concern.\n\nConclusion: it really worth the money and the time invested! It is the best course that I have done so far!!

I received a lot of information about JavaScript properties, their uses and how they can be combined to produce useful blocks of code.\n\nThe introduction outlining many of the properties of JavaScript was a little overwhelming; the information cannot be sufficiently internalised until much practice with it has taken place.

There is a jump in difficulty between the fundamentals and then the practical projects, but the jump is required to take you to the next level. As with every programming course that I've done so far, you do have to do a bit of your own research and reading around the topic to fully understand any concepts that may confuse you. That is to be expected though as no instructor can hold your hand at every step as the course would be 100+ hrs long.\n\nBrad is an excellent and down-to-earth teacher and I highly rate his tutorials. His Youtube channel, Traversy Media, is brilliant and i'll be enrolling in all his other Udemy courses to teach myself full-stack development in the aim of getting my first job in the industry.

There is a jump in difficulty between the fundamentals and then the practical projects, but the jump is required to take you to the next level. As with every programming course that I've done so far, you do have to do a bit of your own research and reading around the topic to fully understand any concepts that may confuse you. That is to be expected though as no instructor can hold your hand at every step as the course would be 100+ hrs long.</p>\n\n<p>Brad is an excellent and down-to-earth teacher and I highly rate his tutorials. His Youtube channel, Traversy Media, is brilliant and i'll be enrolling in all his other Udemy courses to teach myself full-stack development in the aim of getting my first job in the industry. You can't go wrong with any of Brad's courses. Good luck to you all! ;)</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 28913124, "content": "Quite useful, and very thorough.

My main criticism is that Brad (the instructor) rushes through the concepts while they are still being introduced in each section, and doesn't provide enough (if at all) examples or explanations but simply demonstrating how things are syntactically written in Javascript. It is no doubt our job as students to practice and research on our own beyond this and any course. However it's very discouraging to spend so much time and energy to finally understand whats been explained, only to move on to the next section and repeat this process again. For absolute beginners especially I'd recommend checking other videos/tutorials elsewhere before diving into the concepts that are introduced here. Make sure you check all Q&A as they are a great source of information!\n\nNow that said, one of the things that I really like about Brad's videos are the projects, completely built from scratch and going through each line of code. This is a great exercise that shows you clearly how things are done (or can be done), and gives you enough practice to understand the tools at your disposal. If you've been paying attention you will be able to tell where Brad is intentionally doings things in a 'sloppy' way so that you can then go an improve it yourself.

My main criticism is that Brad (the instructor) rushes through the concepts while they are still being introduced in each section, and doesn't provide enough (if at all) examples or explanations but simply demonstrating how things are syntactically written in Javascript. It is no doubt our job as students to practice and research on our own beyond this and any course. However it's very discouraging to spend so much time and energy to finally understand whats been explained, only to move on to the next section and repeat this process again. For absolute beginners especially I'd recommend checking other videos/tutorials elsewhere before diving into the concepts that are introduced here. Make sure you check all Q&A as they are a great source of information!</p>\n\n<p>Now that said, one of the things that I really like about Brad's videos are the projects, completely built from scratch and going through each line of code. This is a great exercise that shows you clearly how things are done (or can be done), and gives you enough practice to understand the tools at your disposal. If you've been paying attention you will be able to tell where Brad is intentionally doings things in a 'sloppy' way so that you can then go an improve it yourself.

Unfortunately, I've had a hard time figuring out his target audience because he seems to waver a bit on the level at which he's presenting.\n\nOn the one hand, he describes how variables can be const while the content of const reference variables can be modified (which is a totally basic concept to anyone that's programmed in ANY language for more than a year).\n\nOn the other hand, he skips over detailed discussions of the differences between a NodeList and an HtmlList in the DOM. It's pretty easy to pick up the differences via context while watching him talk *around* these topics, but a targeted description of these differences is important, I would think, in this course.\n\nHe spends way too much time repeating similar concepts. For example, he shows how you can use offsetY to get the Y offset of the mouse in a mouse event, and then spends an *equal* amount of time showing you how you can use offsetX to obtain the X offset. That's ridiculous - you'd have to be a complete idiot to need the same level of discussion for the second of these after a detailed description of the first. I would have described and demonstrated offsetY and then mentioned you can do the same with offsetX and let it go.\n\nThis sort of thing happens time and time again in this course.

I can only assume he has a secondary goal in his presentations of content completeness, perhaps for the sake of the downloadable material, but this is not the right way to build course content.

This course doesn't seem to be built for those seeking to know depth for what's being done and why. The instructor is very talented as I've saw some of his postings on youtube! Pleasant speaker. Could easily be one of the best courses and highest-selling if adjustments were made in the future. If it were not so, I wouldn't even post this review. Also, it's a constant mention in the reviews that the instructor doesn't reach back. Do better! That is all. Carry on. Go with God.

For each lecture I keep the completed project file open in VS Code.  As I follow along with the video, I'll edit each file comments to take my notes, and play with the existing file to learn more.  Sometime I add features to learn more.  For me this is better than typing all the code.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks Brad!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 61900440, "content": "Brad is amazing in terms of teaching and making things simpler.

Go check him out! As I say, I took this course blindly, but knowing Brad wouldn't put anything but 110% into it.
