While correcting the video is difficult, he will be looking into providing access to code resources. The code plus using my browser following his explaining the Material-UI docs will overcome the two issues I listed. I'll add the 5th review star once Zachary provides the code resources.<br>_____________________________________________</p>\n\n<p>This would be an excellent course \u2014 IF \u2014 two seriously needed corrections would be made:</p>\n\n<p>1) The display of the instructor's code editor is illegible for students with normal 20/20 vision.  <br>2) The course needs downloadable resources ESPECIALLY since the display of the instructor's code editor is just way too small.</p>\n\n<p>If these two issues are corrected, this course would easily be a 5+ star course simply because the instructor is articulate, explains the details behind each step, and clearly knows his subject.</p>\n\n<p>Providing downloadable resources (issue #2, above) would be a giant step for improving the rating of the course. Solving this issue should be quick since it does not involve editing or reshooting the video lessons.</p>\n\n<p>I hope to hear a reply from Zachary.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 69006988, "content": "i felt that the instructor could speed up a bit", "rating": 2.5, "created": "2020-10-22T09:35:20Z", "modified": "2020-10-23T08:06:23Z", "user_modified": "2020-10-22T09:36:34Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 115786198, "title": "Anoop Venugopalan", "name": "Anoop", "display_name": "Anoop Venugopalan", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "AV"}, "response": {"_class": "course_review_response", "id": 6354486, "content": "Hi there, if the videos are too slow for you, you can use playback controls to watch them at 1.5 or 2x speed.", "created": "2020-10-23T10:43:30Z", "modified": "2020-10-23T10:43:30Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 10184590, "title": "Zachary Reece", "name": "Zachary", "display_name": "Zachary Reece", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/10184590_5a62_2.jpg", "initials": "ZR"}, "content_html": "<p>Hi there, if the videos are too slow for you, you can use playback controls to watch them at 1.5 or 2x speed.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, "content_html": "<p>i felt that the instructor could speed up a bit</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 61393690, "content": "Yes.
