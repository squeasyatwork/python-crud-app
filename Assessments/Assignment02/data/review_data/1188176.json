You need to know at least the syntax of PHP before doing this course or you will be confused at the beginning until you've done enough. The instructor doesn't really take the time to explain the syntax of the languages but more just goes straight into it. Another thing, is that I felt best practices were not used in this course. It felt as if the code was all over the place but that could just be PHP (I'm fairly new to PHP so this just may the case of the language). If you are an absolute beginner, I would not recommend the course but if you are a beginner looking for more PHP practice then I would definitely recommend this course. All in all though, good job to the instructor cause I definitely did learn a lot from this course!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 10971538, "content": "Reece has done it again!\n\nThis is a great follow up to to his \"Social Media Website\" course.

You may be completely different.\nI found the first 60-70% really good and it only started to dip towards the end. For some parts I ended up copying what he did and even though Reece does explain everything, there comes a point where copying something and listening to an explanation isn't as useful when the topics become a little more complex. I feel like the ajax other advanced parts need covering separately before you start using them in the project.\nI also don't want this to sound harsh but Reece does make mistakes a little more frequently towards the end and it disrupted the flow of the project for me as I tried to get my head around some newer topics. \n\nI'm not convinced you should do this until you've covered basic HTML, basic CSS, basic javascript and basic PHP.
