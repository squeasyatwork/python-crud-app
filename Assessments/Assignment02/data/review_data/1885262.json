And even better, gave me the tools I needed to undestand, build and extend custom tools that have saved me a bunch of time of development.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a \"Let's build X thing\" kind of course, though. I personally see it as everything the Angular docs were hoping to be, but better. Not only explaining why something works, but more importantly, why it doesn't. It was this ability to force common errors and explain in detail why they happen, and after that, going in detail on how to avoid them or fix them, that I liked the most.</p>\n\n<p>This course is definitely a must buy for anyone who wants to learn Angular.
