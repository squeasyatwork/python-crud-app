You should really have a decent knowledge of how Angular works before diving into this course. However, if you're just looking for information how to set up a MEAN stack app with a focus on the API, this is a good choice.\n\nThat being said, I have two comments. First, I wish the teacher would have used more shortcuts. E.g. ng g c <name> There seems to be some time wasted in not using these. Secondly, there's a lot of time wasted in figuring out what the errors are. Since this isn't a course for beginners, I wish he would have paused the video until he found a solution, and continued from that point. Better yet, be sure your video has minimal errors in order to not waste time correctng silly errors. I understand we all make mistakes and come across errors, but for the sake of time I wish the practice of finding solutions to errors/bugs was removed from this video.\n\nAddendum: I will add that the further I got into this course, I realized it was incomplete. Unfortunately, the instructor does not give any finished examples of what the code should look like after every section nor at the end of the course. Additionally, there seem to be video snippets left out, because I would get to a certain point in the video and realize that a bit of code had been added to the instructors code, but wasn't in mine, nor did I remember ever going over it in previous lessons. This makes the course a bit harder to follow along to. So again, you need to have some good experience with Angular if you want to take this course. This is definitely not for a beginner wanting to learn Angular.'\n\nUnfortunately, I have to take off another star as I see there have been numerous posts for help in the QA section, but the teacher has not responded to any of them within the past month. Since the teacher skips around a bit during the course (some lessons are not in the correct order), then there are times you may need some guidance in order to correct your code, but unfortunately the teacher doesn't answer questions the students have. This could be a decent course, but it doesn't look like the teacher is really enthusiastic about assisting.
