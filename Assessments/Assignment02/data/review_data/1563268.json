I changed my 3 star rating to 5 stars because of the 2021 course.  I highly recommend this course to anyone that needs to learn what is listed in the course description.  The course material is clearly explained and has good examples.  The only thing missing with the new material is versioning, it is available in the old material though (section 25: versioning).\n\nOriginal review (3 stars), which now starts at Section 17: Introduction\nThe course can be worth taking to get an overview of the basics.  There are no other courses specifically for learning REST in .NET CORE so it is this or a different website.  I had a few issues.  The instructor frequently rushes and at times the video speed is obviously faster than normal.  It would have been nice if he made the course 30 minutes longer.  I had to use Google to find answers on why my solution didn't build when his did.  A few times I noticed code was added that he didn't discuss, nothing major but it was annoying.  Other times the video cuts go from no code to having code without mentioning it.  He also has an accent that can be hard to understand when he talks too fast.

The only thing missing with the new material is versioning, it is available in the old material though (section 25: versioning).</p>\n\n<p>Original review (3 stars), which now starts at Section 17: Introduction<br>The course can be worth taking to get an overview of the basics.  There are no other courses specifically for learning REST in .NET CORE so it is this or a different website.  I had a few issues.  The instructor frequently rushes and at times the video speed is obviously faster than normal.  It would have been nice if he made the course 30 minutes longer.
