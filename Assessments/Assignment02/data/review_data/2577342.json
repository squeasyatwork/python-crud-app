Section 1 taught me how to create a Build System using Webpack and Babel that will help to automatically convert higher versions of JS to ES5 that most browsers support and also hot-reload our program on each save without us having to manually refresh the browser.  This knowledge will not only help with this course, but in future projects too.  The first lecture in Section 7 helped me better understand closures and the assignment in the coding challenge in the second lecture helped me write a function using closure to mimic the builtin Math.pow() function.\n\nPros (thus far):\n\u2022\tExcellent production quality in terms of video and audio quality.\n\u2022\tExcellently prepared slides that include animation/special effects.\n\u2022\tAdequate font size and zoom level.\n\u2022\tWell-prepared, knowledgeable instructors.\n\u2022\tThoughtful use of relevant comments in the code and \"popups\" over the video to highlight/reinforce some point being made in the video.\n\u2022\t\"Coding Challenges\" included into the lessons itself to help us evaluate our understanding of concepts that were taught in the same (or previous) lesson.  \n\nAreas of improvement:  It's really not that much of a problem, but the useful \"popups\" (not sure about the correct term for those) that are superimposed on the videos are coming at the very bottom of the screen and hence can be missed when concentrating on the code above and sometimes obscured by the \"video progress bar\" of the Udemy platform.  Hence, I suggest looking into its placement for future courses.\n\nI am eagerly looking forward to complete the rest of the course as it contains many important concepts of JS that I am aiming to learn.  Based on the teaching style in the lessons that I have watched thus far, I am confident that this course will be beneficial for me as well as my fellow students too.\n\nThanks, John and George Juarez, for this New Year gift.
