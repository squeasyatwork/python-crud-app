Even after using Angular now for nearly 3 years I learned a LOT of new things to add to my toolbox.\n\nMany concepts are difficult to understand (IMO) but Vasco does a great job explaining what the section is about, the problem with the 'normal' way of doing it, and explains the benefits of the pure Reactive RxJs way of doing it. Often he will show in code the traditional (pre-Reactive) version, and then convert it over to Reactive RxJs. Everything is explained fully, and I even appreciate how he starts each video with a summary of where he left off from the previous video, and what needs to be done next. Then at the end of each video often will summarize what was done in the video to help solidify the concepts.\n\nHe is also careful to have the proper zoom level so you can see all the relevant code in one screen (if possible).\n\nVasco also will answer any question in the comments within a couple days, which is much appreciated.\n\nMy only complaint (and this goes for all his courses) is the \"look/feel\" of his IDE.
