He does what just a little of other instructor can do, break down every and each part of whatever he is teaching and bring the subject in small pieces, so you can absorb easily what you learning. This is my 2nd (so far) course of him and already planning to buy another one. \nHe is calm, talks slow, so you can have your time to understand and process everything, and he is very responsive to his Q&A, so, buying a course of him, is not just buying a course. Is about getting full support as well.  Great way to help you out whenever you stuck in your studies.  \n\nKeep learning, keep practicing =)\n\nEdit 1 (asked me on lecture 57) - this is one of the most amazing JS course I done. Seriously. I tried dozen of other courses, but only in this one I really grasp the missing concepts and whats is really needed to deeply understand everything. Vojislav ALWAYS explains the \"why\" before the \"how\". In other words, he will show you why you need to use that before showing you how, that what happens in 90% of any other courses. This helps you a lot to really understanding why and when you will use that piece of code.  Until now, the course is being masterful. =)\n\nEdit 2 (end of course)... this course is still amazing and Vojislav makes you understand every single line . He not only throw the code, he show you why he is using that code and why. Thanks for this amazing course!", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2019-03-04T17:52:29-08:00", "modified": "2019-03-22T22:01:21-07:00", "user_modified": "2019-03-22T22:01:21-07:00", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 16844618, "title": "Fabrizio Tofanelli", "name": "Fabrizio", "display_name": "Fabrizio Tofanelli", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/16844618_6872.jpg", "initials": "FT"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Vojislav is an amazing teacher.
