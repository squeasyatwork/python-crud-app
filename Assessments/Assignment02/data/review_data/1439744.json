The project, a chat blog, is the real jewel of this course.  You build it with React and connect to a real database.  Along the way, the instructor dives deep into the front-end explanation, and he provides just enough back-end instruction for you to comfortably interface your React app with Node.js and MongoDB.  This course is not an easy one, but it is an excellent choice for those who want to broaden their JavaScript skills and learn how to build full-featured sites and applications using React.  Brad\u2019s approach to teaching is to the point; he does not waste time on superfluous chat or instruction.  His React course clocks in at just under 16 hours in length, but each minute of instruction is spot on with high educational value and clear direction.  Thus, do not be fooled by the relatively short length of his course.  It is power packed with tons of valuable information for inspiring React developers.  Before I took Brad\u2019s course, I knew little to nothing about React.  Now, I have the confidence and the skill to build full React applications using a wide cross-section of custom and third-party components and tools.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 56319418, "content": "Excellent.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2020-05-25T06:50:21Z", "modified": "2020-05-26T06:08:48Z", "user_modified": "2020-05-25T06:50:57Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 30576308, "title": "Vidril", "name": "Vidril", "display_name": "Vidril", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "V"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Excellent.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 54289390, "content": "This isn't the first class I purchased from Brad.
