Learning was the point (and making something really cool!)  The learning, though, hasn't been any book learning.\n\nI can tell you that there are things called objects and methods, lists, tupples, and functions, that API views are different from standard views, but I couldn't tell you what they are and when exactly to use them.  If you need to be able to do that - this is not the course for you.\n\nHow I learn (if you don't learn similarly - this review may not be of much use to you):\nI learn by doing.  I repeat something enough times that I then begin to understand or recognize the underlying patterns.  I don't worry about understanding \"why\" and working it out rationally or logically yet.\n\nI begin to develop a \"sense\" of what to expect and start to begin \"guessing\" at what might come next - not by thinking it through yet, but by building my intuitive sense.\n\nThen, once I've seen and tried, and made mistakes and got frustrated and then figured out the solutions (reviewing and reviewing again where I messed up or googling solutions), then I work at understanding the conceptual/logical/rational part of learning, so I can marry the intuitive with the logical.\n\nOk - with that out of the way:\nI struggled quite a bit at the beginning.  It took me MANY hours to get set up and get going.  In addition, I used django 2.02 and python 3.6.  That, however, was on me (this course is specifically for django v. 1).\n\nFor those wondering, it's not that big of a difference to use django v.2 and python v3, but you do need to be able to google search when you come up against the version changes affecting what you do.\n\nI'd never set up and tried to do any local development (on my computer), never worked with the OS Terminal, never set up python or django, and never set up virtual environments.  I probably will use the terminology poorly - I didn't care about this part for this course (as mentioned in \"how I learn\").\n\nBe forewarned, you will have to figure out a lot on your own if you don't know something about how to do these things prior to starting this course.  I knew I was in for a vertical learning curve, so I was ok with it.\n\nIn general, I've found the course (I have a few lessons left) to be very quick.  The most challenging part for me is the rapidity with which the presenter moves through the material in conjunction with a tendency to be vague in his verbal descriptions about what exactly he is doing.\n\nThere is a lot of \"go here\", \"that's why you do this\", \"it's going to look like this\" and scrolling very quickly through the files.  Sometimes it's hard to know which folder he's in and where he copying and pasting code to - I had to re-watch segments repeatedly and hunt through at times.\n\nThis seems to occur more when he comes up against unexpected errors/problems and is trying to problem solve.  It can be hard to follow.\n\nAs the learner, it would help to know, for example: \"now we're going to the views.py filed under the tweets API folder.  Given that there are several views.py files in different folders, for example, it can get confusing.\n\nThe one benefit is that this vagueness then forces you to go through files and re-watch segments so you get more and more familiar with them and have a better sense of where to look on your own.\n\nAs you develop more familiarity with what kind of material would appropriately go into which \"views.py\" file, for example, then you would know to go into the tweets/api folder views.py file.  But if you're just beginning, it can be very confusing.\n\nIt helped to pause the video and follow along at every code change - I constantly refreshed my tab to note if something got screwed up so I could fix it before making too many changes and not knowing what got screwed up.  \n\nSometimes, the presenter doesn't note that a problem will get fixed in a video and then screwed up by some other change - and that you're supposed to wait until the next video to follow along on how to re-fix it.\n\nIt would help to know that you haven't screwed something up - you're still following along correctly, even if you're seeing problems with the code.\n\nI think what made it easier to follow along through most of the beginning videos is that he forecasted what would happen in the next video by noting what needed to be fixed at the end of each video.\n\nI started getting into trouble at the Tweet-list loading everywhere and Endpoint API videos. I found them to be very hard to follow.\n\nThe presenter had to problem-solve a number of issues so there were a number of iterations of trying things that didn't work.  There was also cutting and pasting.  Along with the fast scrolling in the video, it was sometimes difficult to know where you were supposed to be putting what.\n\nUltimately, the presenter has all the code posted on github for each lesson.  For the most part, it is a very helpful resource that I wish I'd looked at sooner to figure out where I'd gone wrong.\n\nSome of it didn't seem to jive with the lessons, but for the most part it did, and was very useful and when I got completely upended.\n\nCheck it out sooner rather than later at the codingforentrepreneurs website / projects / tweetme / code - then scrolling down on github to see the list of the chapters to get the specific changes made for each video lesson.  That was awesome.\n\nAgain, I've learned A LOT - and would recommend this course if Google is your friend and you're not expecting someone to spell it all out for you.\n\nYou will likely learn a great deal by making mistakes and trying to figure out how to solve them.  When you get too far down the rabbit hole, the code examples for each chapter are an invaluable resource.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPS - just finished the course and have a fully functional twitter-like clone app, and it's super COOL!  thank you, Justin :)", "rating": 4.0, "created": "2018-04-20T12:56:12Z", "modified": "2018-05-22T15:25:06Z", "user_modified": "2018-05-13T12:39:15Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 8456526, "title": "Eva Rubin", "name": "Eva", "display_name": "Eva Rubin", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "ER"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Given that each person learns slightly differently, I'll describe how I learn (so you can tell if this review will be useful to you), and describe what I've liked and what has been frustrating/challenging about this course.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I've learned A LOT - and that is the reason why I'm giving it 4 stars.
