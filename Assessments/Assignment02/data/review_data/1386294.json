I like how the instructor never skipped over the basics. He took the time to explain at each lecture if needed.<br>It was a bit frustrating to waster 30mins on the very last lecture installing a new program though.<br>Also, it would be helpful to have a bigger zoom on his console / screen. Because if you are watching the lecture and working on python at the same time, the letters can be just too small.<br>Overall a good course</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 46923048, "content": "i have learnt lot of things , but its a basic of python and some part of python is not there. like pandas,mat plot,sci,etc. also do share me the link of codes and document. it will be help for me", "rating": 3.0, "created": "2020-03-08T08:47:36Z", "modified": "2020-03-13T05:56:28Z", "user_modified": "2020-03-13T05:56:28Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 85040022, "title": "Sunny Bindal", "name": "Sunny", "display_name": "Sunny Bindal", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "SB"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>i have learnt lot of things , but its a basic of python and some part of python is not there. like pandas,mat plot,sci,etc. also do share me the link of codes and document. it will be help for me</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 46058826, "content": "The Runtime Polymorphism video was bad and assumed knowledge of Java programming.\nCustom exceptions are not covered in the videos but are assessed in the assignment.\nOverall a fantastic course for developing in python.", "rating": 4.0, "created": "2020-02-22T09:35:35Z", "modified": "2020-02-22T18:08:08Z", "user_modified": "2020-02-22T09:36:54Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 102547115, "title": "Stuart Wagner", "name": "Stuart", "display_name": "Stuart Wagner", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "SW"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>The Runtime Polymorphism video was bad and assumed knowledge of Java programming.<br>Custom exceptions are not covered in the videos but are assessed in the assignment.<br>Overall a fantastic course for developing in python.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 55856990, "content": "This course is very helpful to me for increase my programming skills and the instructor is very good to explain every concept in this course.it's very simple to understanding every concept", "rating": 4.5, "created": "2020-05-20T22:34:10Z", "modified": "2020-09-11T00:01:09Z", "user_modified": "2020-09-11T00:01:09Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 119232450, "title": "saran kumar Panda", "name": "saran kumar", "display_name": "saran kumar Panda", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "SP"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>This course is very helpful to me for increase my programming skills and the instructor is very good to explain every concept in this course.it's very simple to understanding every concept</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 32456090, "content": "The instructor is good in explaining the basic concepts, but the course lacks real world applications.
