O curso baseia os exemplos com a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do Payara Micro Server mas n\u00e3o tive dificuldades em adaptar para outros servidores JEE. A explica\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 muito detalhada e chega a ser at\u00e9 cansativa em alguns momentos pelo esfor\u00e7o repetitivo que o instrutor faz em transmitir a informa\u00e7\u00e3o de modo que at\u00e9 o menos familiarizados possam entender. O \u00e1udio \u00e9 um pouco ruim, havendo ru\u00eddos de fundo durante boa parte das aulas e n\u00e3o ouve um cuidado de filtrar sibilos e estalos captados pelo microfone durante as explica\u00e7\u00f5es do instrutor. De forma geral ficou acima das minhas expectativas e recomendo o curso sem d\u00favida alguma.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 58331757, "content": "Great course that covers a lot of topics.
