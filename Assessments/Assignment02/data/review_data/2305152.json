I'm coming from 6 months of learning React and really wish I would have known about Quasar back then.  The combination of Vue and Quasar far exceeds my expectations.  I know I have more to learn but I can already see the overwhelming benefits to Quasar/Vue over React (and I haven't even gotten into the multi-platform build topics)...
