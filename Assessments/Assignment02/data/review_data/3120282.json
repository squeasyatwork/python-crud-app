Perfect for beginners who know general web-development, and a good refresher for those learnt in the Shopify field. A course for actual development and not the rearrangement of pre-built code: a treasure indeed.\n\nI particularly love this course because it is the only one so far to build everything from scratch. Others would explain what the already-made code found in the Dawn/Debut themes would do for the theme, or provide snippets the instructor made themselves behind the scenes. But this course sweeps all that under the rug and makes its own structure of development, explaining every inch of every step of the way. The best part? Whatever we've built in this course is super speedy, highly manageable, and reusable for reference or future development in new themes. \n\nFor my personal approach to learning development, this course does a great job in remaining well structured, allowing for organized note-taking and easy referral to past lessons for any refreshers. I can't stress enough how much I appreciate someone taking the time needed to build a theme from scratch to show how everything fits together as one, whole project; it really helps when you have no idea where to start or where to go from learning the basics.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2021-09-10T18:46:59Z", "modified": "2021-09-12T16:06:52Z", "user_modified": "2021-09-10T19:05:02Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 137595874, "title": "Khaled Ajaj", "name": "Khaled", "display_name": "Khaled Ajaj", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "KA"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>This amazing course is THE GO-TO for Shopify theme development.
