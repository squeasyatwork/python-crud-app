If you have heard of GraphQL and wanted to get a bit more familiar with it for querying data from the frontend then this course is for you. You will also learn about one of my favorite tools for creating frontend websites quickly and efficiently, Gatsby. Which combines the best of React with GraphQL for a very unique way of creating your website without the need or use of a backend. If you are wanting to learn of the most in demand skills for web and app development then look no further than this course.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "10 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 83862844, "content": "Everything has been excellent!", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2021-05-01T19:47:26Z", "modified": "2021-05-02T16:04:25Z", "user_modified": "2021-05-01T19:47:45Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 33039974, "title": "Jorge Santamaria", "name": "Jorge", "display_name": "Jorge Santamaria", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "JS"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Everything has been excellent!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "5 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 72085828, "content": "SPOT on training approach 5/5.

So when you have a typo you have to look back and forth trying to find the error while wondering: Did I make a mistake or did Yihua white-washe it again by fooling us that it works? <br>There's a lot of repeating of things that are not important, obvious lack of planning, lack of teaching experience and most important, NO BOOK!!! Why? If the course replaces the teacher then where's the book? How fast can you find something in a video? Maybe the book should just give the important lines of script while the blabla is in the videos. Maybe the lesson titles in the book could link to the video counterparts. That way, if you need to find something, you look in the book. If you need more, you click on the title and watch the lesson.<br>Also, at some point one of the non-video lessons corrects the following video saying that since 2019 the apollo way has changed. You put 2020 in the course's title!!! Why wasn't this video and the ones with errors redone? How about the ones where Yihua refactors the names of variables?<br>Some of the mistakes in here are already huge on their own, when you add them all together, it becomes more than ridiculous.<br>I'm sorry Andrei but you shouldn't have attached your name to this.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 53477152, "content": "The instructor Andrei needs to slow down.  75% playback speed was necessary and I frequently had to pause the video to catch one or two seconds of key segments of video.  \n \nUse of the Zoom/Focus tool was very frustrating.

Yihua first used file name 'preview-collection.component.jsx' and decided to change it to 'collection-preview.jsx' and drops 'component' in doing so without saying anything. I had been following his style (that had been highlighted earlier by Andrei)  so without noticing it changed it to 'collection-preview.component.jsx', following his style. I continued to follow his code later to import it from 'collection-preview' at 8:59. Later it didn't compile and ended up wasting 1.5 hours to see where the problem was. There are inconsistencies at different places and occasions where he quietly changes things without saying anything or while talking over it about something else.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 62498952, "content": "already feeling equipped to start building projects already and am just halfway through...", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2020-07-29T03:09:01Z", "modified": "2020-08-13T03:45:46Z", "user_modified": "2020-08-13T03:45:46Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 13180970, "title": "Timothy Asigbey", "name": "Timothy", "display_name": "Timothy Asigbey", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "TA"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>already feeling equipped to start building projects already and am just halfway through...</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 33664962, "content": "I have already done ZtM and JtS courses from Andrei and they both are great.

This has been a very good course. This is actually my second course I take on Udemy regarding React. I am a web developer for many years, but I've had most experience with AngularJS, and more old technologies (I started coding in JavaScript in the year 2000, with notepad, and almost no resources online, when Internet Explorer was ruling the web) like jQuery, and just vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.\nI think Andrei and Yihua's explanations were really good. I like the fact you get the fundamentals and basic ideas, sometimes shown with charts, before you deep-dive into the thing itself. My knowledge and understanding of the React ecosystem is now better.\nI have also enjoyed how you got to a point where the app is implemented with Redux, and then you keep going back to this point and refactor the entire codebase to work with different features like Hooks and Context, etc.\nIt's also nice that you get to learn some things beyond React itself, like how to work wit Firebase and GatsbyJs.\nHowever, there is something I like less, and it's the fact that the newer features of React are not presented as thoroughly as the older ones. This course is named \u201cComplete React Developer in 2020\u201d, so I would expect React Hooks feature to get a lot of spotlight. Hooks like useCallback and useMemo are explained flawlessly, in your amazing way that makes even the most beginner understand the subject easily, but I would love to see some real-life scenarios where you would need to use these features, just like you splendidly did with the older features.

This has been a very good course. This is actually my second course I take on Udemy regarding React. I am a web developer for many years, but I've had most experience with AngularJS, and more old technologies (I started coding in JavaScript in the year 2000, with notepad, and almost no resources online, when Internet Explorer was ruling the web) like jQuery, and just vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.<br>I think Andrei and Yihua's explanations were really good. I like the fact you get the fundamentals and basic ideas, sometimes shown with charts, before you deep-dive into the thing itself. My knowledge and understanding of the React ecosystem is now better.<br>I have also enjoyed how you got to a point where the app is implemented with Redux, and then you keep going back to this point and refactor the entire codebase to work with different features like Hooks and Context, etc.<br>It's also nice that you get to learn some things beyond React itself, like how to work wit Firebase and GatsbyJs.<br>However, there is something I like less, and it's the fact that the newer features of React are not presented as thoroughly as the older ones. This course is named \u201cComplete React Developer in 2020\u201d, so I would expect React Hooks feature to get a lot of spotlight. Hooks like useCallback and useMemo are explained flawlessly, in your amazing way that makes even the most beginner understand the subject easily, but I would love to see some real-life scenarios where you would need to use these features, just like you splendidly did with the older features.

Yes, it started with simple stuff (by Andrei) which is really good. But down the road, it's all by Yihua and that is where things get worse. There are things taught by Yihua which Andrei himself not agreed upon.\n\nLittle background about myself. I'm from training & consultant industry so training & teaching is my field.\n\nThe positive sides:\nThe content coverage is really good. You basically learnt a lot of the real industry standard stuff and practices. There are graphical explanation which is good at introducing complex topic. Yihua also have deep understanding about his topic.\n\nThe negative sides:\nThe main negative aspect is a person, who is Yihua himself. If you read all the reviews & Q&A (inside the course), you will notice many students complain about his style. Here is my shot:\n\nYihua recorded all the lecture videos WITHOUT learner point of view in mind. Let me explain. You must understand when the student on the other side of the screen watching and coding along, the constantly zoom in & out and switching windows rapidly here and it is a terrible experience to follow along. His coding speed is lightning fast, even find the right timing to pause the video is challenging.\n\nHe speaks fast. From learning perspective, learners' mind need to stop & think about particulat point. But he chunk in all points into few fast pace sentences. I tried to slow down the video and that helps a bit, but not much.\nWhen you see a Udemy course a relies too much on Q&A to really explain things, you can confirm that the lecture videos are done poorly. There are times when things need to explain clearly, but he didn't. Because he didn't have the learner's mind in hand. He thinks more in his own shoes than student's when recording.\n\nI notice there are many times when a complicated topic is done explaining, he will follow by something like this: \"This topic tough & complicated, if you don't understand it, it is perfectly fine.\" I'm sorry, I purchase & attend a course to understand & learn things, thus, it's not okay if you fail to explaining things.\n\nI guess all the student will instantly feel how pleasant it is to watch video by Andrei when Andrei suddenly popups in one of those video to loosen the tension.\n\nAbout the teaching assistants:\nTY is the best of all. The amount of effort he put in answer question amazed me. I would like to personally think him for his contribution. He dive deep into questioner's mind and explain things in great details. May all the best thing happens in your life TY.\n\nOn the other hand, Dan is the worst I have ever seen. Almost all his answer is very perfunctory. To a point that I almost wanted to put a remark in my question that said: \"Dear Dan, please don't reply my question, I prefer other TA.\" But it's not polite to do so. Therefore, the best thing to do is review here so that all people in 0ToMastery can see.\n\nFinal words:\nI'm not one of those student who purchased many courses and never finish any of them. I'm opposite of those. I'm very persistent & discipline that I must finish one whole course before proceeding to the next one. Because I have plan my learning journey well in advance to acquire knowledge step by step to build solid foundation. This is the first time that a course forces me to break my own rule. I have made a decision to stop at 55% (before Redux-Saga) & I feel bad about myself now.\n\nTo Yihua:\nPlease research and attend topic and courses about how to deliver knowledge, how learners learn and how to design online learning experience.
