Tony Explains Concepts that I otherwise was 'just' becoming familiar with and 'including in my code'.  This is extremely beneficial ! For instance,  Dependency Injection is a simple concept but Anthony's manner of Applying and Explaining the 'Resources' that are made available because we inject a  Module, Clarifies this important functionality.   I have never before use $log !  Extremely useful.\n  \nWe build our own Services and again 'this' - no pun intended - really cleared a bunch of things up.  \n\nAt times, Tony drills back down into javascript and html to somewhat parallel what we are actually doing with AngularJS.  We 'Inspect Element' all of the time to Visualize what our code renders and he shows us that at times our code shows up when we Inspect Element and sometimes it does Not but Explains why this happens ! \n\nThere is so much more I can add about the technology Tony teachers.  He also reminds us - at some point - that most Web Developers are self-taught.

Tony Explains Concepts that I otherwise was 'just' becoming familiar with and 'including in my code'.  This is extremely beneficial ! For instance,  Dependency Injection is a simple concept but Anthony's manner of Applying and Explaining the 'Resources' that are made available because we inject a  Module, Clarifies this important functionality.   I have never before use $log !  Extremely useful.<br>  <br>We build our own Services and again 'this' - no pun intended - really cleared a bunch of things up.  </p>\n\n<p>At times, Tony drills back down into javascript and html to somewhat parallel what we are actually doing with AngularJS.  We 'Inspect Element' all of the time to Visualize what our code renders and he shows us that at times our code shows up when we Inspect Element and sometimes it does Not but Explains why this happens ! </p>\n\n<p>There is so much more I can add about the technology Tony teachers.  He also reminds us - at some point - that most Web Developers are self-taught.

If you want a recommendation on *the* course to take for Angular, and if you're trying to find the course that will finally 'crack open' your understanding of Angular, then you just found it.\n\nSo, here is my typical pattern for learning a new framework like Angular. Pick a course, learn, and try to create my own app. Simple right? Well, not quite. You see a lot of courses try to 'front load' the framework. Download the framework, install, and start to build an app, learning some of the cool things that the framework can do along the way. It's instant gratification. It feels like I'm learning loads.\n\nProblem with me has always been, that after the course is finished I find I can't really put what I've learned to use. Why? Because I have really learned by rote. I have a loose conceptual idea of what the framework does, but, I don't have the understanding of what's going on behind the scenes, so I feel that I can't create something publishable. I am not confident enough that I am using the framework the right way and I'm afraid that what I'm building might not be built using proper methods or patterns.\n\nWith Angular, there are simple ways to do things and there are deployment ways to do things. I remember getting caught up regularly with things like this... You learn your framework (or so you think) and realise that the way you were creating your modules was wrong, it worked, but when you compressed your code for publication for instance, it broke. You had to change your code around - you're in a hurry and you're not *quite* sure why you had to change what your changed but, hey it's working now, but are you confident with your changes and can you recreate this the next time and understand what you're doing?\n\nYou go to look for help on Stack and find that the answers are couched in terms that you may not understand (Angular has a lot of terminology), so you've got to go looking for definitions of those terms. On and on you go down the rabbit hole, trying to learn the framework essentially back to front!\n\nThis course changed all of that for me. Every single concept of Angular is explained from the ground up. You don't start with creating an app - you start with understanding exactly what Angular is, and how it works, *and* it's fascinating and highly informative. Watchers, the digest loop, services, Angular context, directives, singletons in services, creating your own services, modules and on and on... everything you need to know about Angular is there, but you only start building any sort of real app about half way through the course. And this is the beauty of this course. When you start building, you know and understand everything you are doing, and you have the language - the vocabulary you need, to being to think like an Angular developer.\n\nNot only will your understanding of Angular be of a much higher level, but now when you go to search for that help for your Angular project online as you continue to learn, you will be able to ask the right questions, and just as importantly, you will be able to understand the terminology in the answers and you'll be able to sort out the good information from the bad.\n\nThis is a superb course. It doesn't provide the 'instant gratification' of some other courses, it manages to provide many more and lasting satisfactions along the road as it opens your eyes to this brilliant framework.\n\nFor the first time, I can walk away from an Angular course with the confidence to build the app I want to build, safe in the knowledge that I can now use the documentation on the Angular site and ask for and understand the help I need on the forums to continue with the framework.\n\nThis course should be called 'required viewing' by the AngularJS team.

As it returns a promise, \"then\" and \"catch\" can be used\n[https://www.udemy.com/learn-angularjs/learn/v4/questions/5353684]\n- the routing with \"#/name\" is does not seem to work, instead \"#!name\" does work but this is not mentioned in the course\n[https://www.udemy.com/learn-angularjs/learn/v4/questions/4618918]\n- for weather API example at the end you have to change the resource.get to not use callback and JSONP. => $resource(\"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather/?APPID=YOURAPPID\")\n[https://www.udemy.com/learn-angularjs/learn/v4/questions/2390654]\n\nNonetheless I think this course is still good and it could make sense to book it if you want to know about AngularJS (angularjs.org).

For my purpose this course was just fine as I think it gave me a lot of insight on how client side scripting can be done.\n\nRegarding the way Tony made up this course I think this is just great. Each section comes with code examples so you always have a good starting point for doing your own coding or you can just check how the code should/may look like. Also each sections seems to perfectly build upon the previous one so you slowly get into the topic with every lessen. I also enjoyed the weather forecast app at the end of the course where one could build its own app by just combining the elements learned in the lessons before.\n\nSo I think the course in general is really good. However, as some examples do no longer work, I cannot rate it better. As AngularJS is in LTS mode now, maybe Tony can put the course up to date as there are most probably no API changes in AngularJS in the future.", "rating": 3.5, "created": "2019-01-13T01:14:53Z", "modified": "2019-01-13T08:01:38Z", "user_modified": "2019-01-13T03:41:25Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 23872116, "title": "Felix Knittel", "name": "Felix", "display_name": "Felix Knittel", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "FK"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Unfortunatley this course is kind of deprecated as Angular is already out and AngularJS is in LTS mode.

The instructor actually explains how everything works, down to the tiny details. Usually when you see a tutorial on AngularJS (or anything else really) the person who made the tutorial at one point does something and says: don't worry about how that works it just does, you don't need to know how it works. That's usually a mistake because something about how that works is extremely important to understand a complex concept.

A few topics I felt deserved more coverage included:\n\n1) dealing with errors. This is a pretty  unforgiving environment. Many of the errors don't get flagged in your own code by the interpreter. They get flagged deep somewhere in the angular code base. I don't know if there are any good guidelines for how to interpret those errors, but it can be hard to trace those back to the problems in your own code.\n\n2) I wished some simplified approaches had been covered for some features of the framework. For example, for directives, the course mentions that you don't HAVE TO isolate the scope, but it is a good practice. Still, I found the \"poking of holes\" to be cumbersome, and, when I write my own directives, I am in control of variable naming in both the controllers and the directives, so I feel I can avoid conflicts. Therefore, I wanted to try not isolating the scope. I ran into issues making that work when I departed from the course. Namely, I had problems getting iterator variables to pass through to the templateUrl. Since not isolating scope is actually the simpler approach, I would have liked to see that demonstrated end to end in the course.\n\n3) I feel that the course could use a few more high-level views of the architecture of angularJS.  This is a system with a number of moving parts. The course dives into the various parts without spending a lot of time relating them to each other, except by example. But the architectural view of  how they all fit together is not strongly presented. The student is left to assemble that system level view on their own. So, for instance, before diving into building directives, Anthony does explain a purpose that they serve. However, it would make the whole ensuing conversation much  more enlightening to have first explained how directives are situated in the architecture, when they get invoked, and how they relate to other components. That's just an example.\n\n4) minor nit: I ran into a lot of situations where my browser was caching old versions of my files. Refresh is not enough to get rid of them sometimes. I had to clear browser history on many occasions. Unless you know to do this, you can be befuddled by why your changes are not having any impact on the app's behavior. It would be good to explain this to students.\n\nHaving said that, I really like:\n\n1) the objective of understanding how the framework operates behind the scenes, so it does not seem like magic and you understand what the framework needs from you.\n\n2) the pace of the course is very reasonable. Perhaps pause just a second or two before switching screens while in the middle of writing code. Switching too fast makes the user constantly have to rewind to look at the code as a guide while entering the code in his/her own editor.\n\n3) the demystification of \"big words\".

It is well taught with simplified, but accurate and thorough, explanations of the various concepts taught throughout the course.\n\nThe instruction either practiced his delivery extensively or re-recorded his videos until they were perfect as there is no stammering, minimal ums and ahs, and virtually no mistakes in delivery or coding (except when done intentionally as a teaching tool).\n\nThe only drawback to the course is that openweathermap.org changed their APIs at some point after the course was created and recorded. Although the instructor did address the changes to the API call in an inserted lesson, the rest of the lessons still used the old API call method, which created confusion for many students, including myself. \n\nIn addition, the daily weather forecast API used by the instructor for the single page application lessons is no longer free. If the student attempts to use the same API as the instructor, s/he will receive errors back without any explanation. This was frustrating.

It teaches what lies behind the code so you understand what you are doing and why, rather than just being told \"this is how you do it\".  You can always look up syntax, but having an understanding of the whys enables you to think through problems.  Acquiring that knowledge is far more difficult than learning the syntax of \"hello, world\".   Anthony Alicea is a gifted teacher.  I wish more, actually, all, courses were taught this way.  I would take any course he taught.  My only \"complaint\" is that I would like to have screen shots/copies of the code presented in the videos.

Acquiring that knowledge is far more difficult than learning the syntax of \"hello, world\".   Anthony Alicea is a gifted teacher.  I wish more, actually, all, courses were taught this way.
