In VS Code, there's a bunch of stuff to do with .NET Core first, and then the code will run using the built-in terminal (not as nice as a new window, but it works).  It's not 'click a Project.cs script and run'.   \n\nI have not found a better solution yet.  I don't expect the C# issues to be covered in the scope of this class.  C# in VS Code is a learning curve in and of itself.  There are some short tutorials out there to search for help.\n\nStill despite all of that, getting C# to run in VS Code was totally worth it.
