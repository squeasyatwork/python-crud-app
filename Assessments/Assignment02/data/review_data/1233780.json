Interesting, you are the only one giving 1 star. If you claim \"product doesn't even work properly\" seems you haven't actually followed the course, since it is explained how to get it to 100% \"work properly\". I noticed you spoke about practices in software design meaning you consider yourself and probably are advanced user. This course is explained and done for less advanced users also, so they could understand why something is done. And not to jump few steps ahead (in maybe better pratices). Some things are done on purpose. It is not true that this project is hardcoded and based on hardcoded idea and duplication. If form has many elements, of course it will have similar code for binding elements to the backend. But the idea there is not duplication, but demonstration. Code works 100% and it is written in object oriented way. It is up to users to change and improve code in whatever they aspect they like. Who stops anyone to write as much abstraction they want. Also, this project is beside local environment tested on the live online hosting also. So you have to be able to enter values for some specific environment (when you speak about hardcoded informations) in such scenarions. In Tomcat configuration file you also have to \"hardocode\" certain value(s). Other places - classes, methods are done with approach to try to avoid hardcode code as much as possible. JDBC is also used, so less advanced users could actually understand what is happening, and get familiar with writing queries with basic Java database layer (Java Database Connectivity). It is done on purpose. Not every of us can jump three places ahead. And when you say \"hardcode everything\" I really you you are not realistic, since you saw preview videos. And since you claim apparently everything is hardcoded, I cannot understand you've decided to buy course, although you claim that. Also, if you haven't noticed, complete CMS (not part, but complete) CMS with various functionalities is included inside this course for relatively small price. I saw statistic - many of users haven't actually saw full course. Please check all lectures, use exactly same software as in course (same Java version, same version of Tomcat, same version of JSF - both for non-mavenized and mavenized versions) and you will be able to make it work 100%. Otherwise you risk that you wouldn't be able to make it work properly. If you aren't satisfied, you can ask for refund, really no problem.
