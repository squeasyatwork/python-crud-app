I've watched all the videos and very carefully typed in every line of code as shown in the videos.  I've paid money for this course based on what it claimed to provide, plus invested my own time and trust in the author. Now my review. \n\nThere are some issues with having to update the Pusher API code he uses if you are using the EU cluster and not the default US, but that is manageable and fair enough and there is a comment on the appropriate video to get you through that.\n\nWhat attracted me to this course was the relative neatness of the goal app.  This remains true.   I'd only give the author a five out of ten for quality of teaching though.  It's called an advanced laravel course, but it spends time early on as if you didn't know anything about laravel. Really the target is people who know php but who might not have a lot of experience with laravel.\n\nIf you are looking for good software engineering practices, you won't find particularly good examples here.  The approach to development is generally to write the entire app or an entire new piece of an app, then just \"see if it works\" at the end.  Then he just says \"well done, it works\".  My app does not work, one event works fine, others don't.\n\nThe app consists of a lot of jquery and a common practice in the videos during development is copy and paste. Plus there is no testing.  \nThere are a few points in the video where inexplicably he lets code run off the end of the screen (massive ternary statements) and doesn't bother formatting it so it is even readable.  So if that is all OK with you then by all means take the course.\n\nI watched it on 2x speed all the way through and it took me slightly over 1 day.  I have an app which half works (i.e., doesn't) and have learnt mostly examples of coding practices that I want to avoid.\n\nI don't have a good grasp of the core principle of pusher / real time laravel - I'll have to look elsewhere to get that working. (The method in the video was to register events and generate listeners - which are not even necessary because we were not listening to any events in laravel itself - this was poor and confusing if the aim was to introduce people new to Pusher - you'll have to learn all that yourself, the videos won't make it clear).\n\nAll this said, after I've gone elsewhere, and started from scratch to get laravel-pusher events working properly, I may be able to come back to this app and clean it up so it works.\n\nUPDATE: after a break and another hour and a half debugging, with the help of the pusher blog, I've tracked down the bug, and it now works. The bug was my own fault, not Arturo's. I was abbreviating $request to $req, then because a lot of what I was following in the videos I didn't understand, I just defaulted to mindless copying, which introduced this bug.   It's was hard not to do this, I think, unless you already know virtually all that is being learned: you have to copy without understanding which is one reason I don't rate the teaching on this course that highly - it's just 'copy this'.
