The information itself is very good.  \n\nSmall complaints: The information needed to complete the CSS 101 project isn't covered until CSS 201.  The excuse that we should figure it out or search the internet is silly.  That is why we are watching the course to get the information.\n\nThe project for CSS 101 should have waited until the end of 201.  \n\nActually, I took notes the whole time for HTML 201 also and gained a lot of information but I couldn't actually do either of the first 2 projects because I only gained the necessary information later in the course!  It can lead to a sense of frustration like maybe I missed something...but no.  It is just revealed in later videos.  \n\nThis is not to take away from the course itself or its value.  The information is great and accurate and he is even entertaining at times.  \n\nStill...if you are reading this buy the course but don't bother with the projects until the end.  Once you actually are taught the basics you can go back and complete the projects much easier.  \n\nI am downgrading from 5 stars to 4.5 stars because of this but this is not a reflection of poor information, just poor structure to the projects.

Level 201 only sometimes builds on level 101. 2. The level is far too basic here. Level 101 is meant for absolute zero beginners and level 201 is for those getting started but with a bit of previous background. So, also beginners. If you already know anything about any of the languages, you're going to get really bored. I was watching videos here at X2 and I was still bored. I made the mistake of buying this course, thinking I'm getting 40 hours of content.. The content is so basic, you're not actually getting that much out of it. There is a lot of irrelevant extras that distract from the learning. As an example, Django 101 is fine with mostly good explanations. But Django 201 starts again from the beginning, only without explanations. Unfortunately, even when it gets complicated, there explanations are lacking. For some reason Django 201 also includes Tailwind, a good tool to learn, but not while you're trying to figure out Django. Django 201 also involves Ajax. Good tool, but it's an unnecessary segue. I think I may have enjoyed his course if I was starting from zero. My main recommendation being an educator myself is build a curriculum and remake the materials. Otherwise, it's very demotivating.

Sounds like you aren't the right student for this course to begin with, you're too advanced for an A-Z bootcamp. Your projects were great, and you asked awesome questions! Topics like Django 201 we cannot assume everyone knows everything from Django 101. Not everyone starts at the 101 level, so we can't assume anything. And a large framework like Django has too many things to learn that differ from person to person, so nothing can be assumed. We did A LOT of market research around the way this course was setup (hundreds of hours) and this was the best approach for most people of all skill levels. This bootcamp is designed to develop your coding skills to the point where you can land a job. I think your feedback for Kalob is a bit harsh and inaccurate, and about 400+ other people on Udemy would likely agree with me.

Sorry you had a bad experience. For the things we tell people to learn and then don't do, it's because there's an order of operations. You can't learn CSS Flexbox or CSS Grid without knowing HTML, which means learning tables (and those are still used on government sites and email templates, so it's applicable). That was just an example, but the history of each feature is important to understand as well. We've only received one other review along the lines of yours, out of the HUNDREDS of reviews we've recieved so far. So I'm going to venture a guess that you had preconceived ideas of how to teach a course before you even entered this course \u2014 OR that you aren't the target demographic for this course but decided to jump in anyway.

It is quite possibly the worst course I've ever taken. He tells you to do things, then in the next lesson, tells you that isn't really the right way to do it, and shows you another way, then says that isn't really the best way, either. So, you're basically learning bad habits, first, before he tells you best practice. Also, he has students trying to do advanced work, before giving a solid foundation, and without the benefit of learning things like flex, bootstrap, etc, first. I am a coder, and I took the course in hopes of being able to recommend a starting point to some friends who want to learn web development. This won't be the course I recommend.
