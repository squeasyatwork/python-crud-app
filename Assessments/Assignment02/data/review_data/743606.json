I am familiar with C# but just haven't done ASP so, this was in my opinion a good place to start. Unfortunately in my humble opinion although I believe the instructor to be knowledgable in the subject, this course is more an Introduction to ASP. If the Instructor wants the course to live up to the title she needs to do lots more work and add more content. The first problem is that although the course supposedly has over 80 modules, half these are basically the course slides which is misleading - the slides should be in the original course modules and not set as separate modules. So really the course only has just over 40 modules. Some of the content seemed a bit repetitive. For example the author seems to take twice as long to say something that should only take half the time which is fine as this is possibly due to the language barrier. The module on ADO.Net needs more work and barely covers ADO and its application to ASP. There should be some additional modules covering some more features of ASP.Net. The course is engaging with good content during the first half or so with examples. I think this course has the potential to be an excellent course and I regretfully gave three stars not because it was bad but because the latter half just seemed to be rushed and really needs more work.
