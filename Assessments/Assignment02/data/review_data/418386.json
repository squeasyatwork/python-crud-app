Perhaps a flow chart, So we can get an idea of how one plans and builds such a project before getting down and dirty into coding.  \n\nBut I give this course fullest rating for one MOST IMPORTANT factor.  I value a Udemy course above all else if there is an active Q&A with either the instructor or a teaching assistant. And guess what, Reece himself answers every single Q&A (as far as I have observed) almost to an unhealthy level!  I mean there are some questions I think he doesn't even need to bother answering but he does and with a sense of enthusiasm and passion.  He answers questions with a full understanding and often outside the scope of the course.  \n\nThe Q&A is a big deal to me on Udemy courses.  And I am not fond of any course that does not take advantage of it, nor do I appreciate courses that sway you to go outside Udemy to some discord channel at the sacrifice of Udemy Q&A.   Q&A is where its at and Reece...well, that is where he is at!  And he's got other newer courses on here, I expect he's on those Q&As too.

Perhaps a flow chart, So we can get an idea of how one plans and builds such a project before getting down and dirty into coding.  </p>\n\n<p>But I give this course fullest rating for one MOST IMPORTANT factor.  I value a Udemy course above all else if there is an active Q&A with either the instructor or a teaching assistant. And guess what, Reece himself answers every single Q&A (as far as I have observed) almost to an unhealthy level!  I mean there are some questions I think he doesn't even need to bother answering but he does and with a sense of enthusiasm and passion.  He answers questions with a full understanding and often outside the scope of the course.  </p>\n\n<p>The Q&A is a big deal to me on Udemy courses.  And I am not fond of any course that does not take advantage of it, nor do I appreciate courses that sway you to go outside Udemy to some discord channel at the sacrifice of Udemy Q&A.   Q&A is where its at and Reece...well, that is where he is at!  And he's got other newer courses on here, I expect he's on those Q&As too. The time he gives to students is more valuable than even the course itself.  </p>\n\n<p>Thank you, Mr MrGregor, you have vastly improved my web development skills in a short period of time.  </p>\n\n<p>I also look forward to your course on trainspotting...</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 23397690, "content": "Leer er weinig van.\nIn hoog temp code intypen zonder dat je de kans krijgt iets te leren.\nOndertitels van zeer slecht kwaliteit en in te hoog tempo.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2018-11-22T06:11:56Z", "modified": "2018-12-11T12:18:09Z", "user_modified": "2018-12-11T12:18:09Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 57837262, "title": "Ab Stevens", "name": "Ab", "display_name": "Ab Stevens", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "AS"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Leer er weinig van.<br>In hoog temp code intypen zonder dat je de kans krijgt iets te leren.<br>Ondertitels van zeer slecht kwaliteit en in te hoog tempo.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 26199516, "content": "C'est un tr\u00e8s bon cours!!!

Being able to develop my own Social Network gives me satisfaction as a developer and the praises from my friends makes me even more happy.<br>Thank You Reece for this awesome course!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 14577688, "content": "Reece tells you in the beginning of the course that he is fully available for questions, and that's 100% true!

If you want to create a MySQL-based site without using a canned and therefore restricted interface, this is the course.\n\nFirstly, this course does EXACTLY what it says. If you follow along and write your own code section-by-section, you will create a real social network.  You will use PHP, CSS, HTML, javascript, and store everything in a MySQL database. If you have any programming ability and some general coding experience, you should be able to determine how to easily customize the site for your own uses.\n\nReece, the instructor, answers course questions almost immediately in the public forum. I've referenced the questions, but have not yet had to post any. He even goes so far as to help people debug their code, which is not technically required by him, as his code is provided at points in the course, up to the time of its presentation in the materials, therefore, he could just say, \"Use the code I have provided\" instead of taking the time to look through error-filled code.\n\nI have two very minor complaints. He uses UK terminology (since he's from the UK, this is understandable), but in programming this can be confusing. In the US, we call the rounded group indicators \"parentheses.\" In the UK, they are called \"brackets.\" We call the square-sided group indicators \"brackets or square brackets.\" This is critical to get correct in programming. Arrays require the [square ones]; parameter lists require the (rounded ones); functions require {braces}. It can cause confusion. My connection sometimes blurs the video, so the proper {brace}, [bracket], or (parenthesis) is not necessarily shown clearly.  As stated, this complaint is very minor.\n\nMy second complaint is that Reece sometimes takes a wrong turn, as it were, in his programming, which we have to go back to correct later.  Proper preparation would have avoided this duplicated corrective effort. Even going back and adding a written video annotation at the point the error is made would help. This has happened maybe three times through 30+ videos, so it is not horribly hard to continue and make the minor corrections when they occur, but it is a time-waster.\n\nI suggest you open a text editor and follow along as Reece does the code, pausing often to type in the code yourself.  Some knowledge of programming is required at the onset, but even without any programming experience, you are going to learn something. \n\nThe course content is five star.  Reece's lack of preparation and sometimes confusing presentation loses one-half to one star, which is why I have rated this course as I have.\n\nI also recommend you find and become familiar with the PHP manual on php.net, stackoverflow.com, w3schools.com, and similar sites for your reference. I suggest, as well, that you debug your own code rather than asking for help.  Most coding is really debugging, and not writing code, until you become fluent with that programming language (when you still spend a lot of time debugging). Do what Reece suggests, when he suggests it. This is not a course for passively watching, but for following along and doing.\n\nEven though I have not given the course five stars, I whole-heartedly suggest anyone interested in developing a functioning MySQL-based site without resorting to canned packages take this course.", "rating": 4.5, "created": "2017-12-19T20:38:22Z", "modified": "2018-05-22T15:19:28Z", "user_modified": "2017-12-20T07:10:48Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 33220738, "title": "Donald R.

As stated, this complaint is very minor.</p>\n\n<p>My second complaint is that Reece sometimes takes a wrong turn, as it were, in his programming, which we have to go back to correct later.  Proper preparation would have avoided this duplicated corrective effort. Even going back and adding a written video annotation at the point the error is made would help. This has happened maybe three times through 30+ videos, so it is not horribly hard to continue and make the minor corrections when they occur, but it is a time-waster.</p>\n\n<p>I suggest you open a text editor and follow along as Reece does the code, pausing often to type in the code yourself.  Some knowledge of programming is required at the onset, but even without any programming experience, you are going to learn something. </p>\n\n<p>The course content is five star.  Reece's lack of preparation and sometimes confusing presentation loses one-half to one star, which is why I have rated this course as I have.</p>\n\n<p>I also recommend you find and become familiar with the PHP manual on php.net, stackoverflow.com, w3schools.com, and similar sites for your reference. I suggest, as well, that you debug your own code rather than asking for help.  Most coding is really debugging, and not writing code, until you become fluent with that programming language (when you still spend a lot of time debugging). Do what Reece suggests, when he suggests it. This is not a course for passively watching, but for following along and doing.</p>\n\n<p>Even though I have not given the course five stars, I whole-heartedly suggest anyone interested in developing a functioning MySQL-based site without resorting to canned packages take this course.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 26920634, "content": "Very good course so far", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2019-02-04T11:01:20Z", "modified": "2019-03-30T04:37:06Z", "user_modified": "2019-03-30T04:37:06Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 49847132, "title": "Ian Storey", "name": "Ian", "display_name": "Ian Storey", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "IS"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Very good course so far</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 21539532, "content": "yes it was a good match", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2018-10-04T10:47:48Z", "modified": "2018-11-02T18:33:56Z", "user_modified": "2018-11-02T18:33:56Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 53417378, "title": "Kennedy Mwangi", "name": "Kennedy", "display_name": "Kennedy Mwangi", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "KM"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>yes it was a good match</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 65827450, "content": "It is an amazing course", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2020-09-08T04:20:41Z", "modified": "2021-07-11T04:44:36Z", "user_modified": "2021-07-11T04:44:36Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 120364960, "title": "Mohsin Bilal", "name": "Mohsin", "display_name": "Mohsin Bilal", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "MB"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>It is an amazing course</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 26517752, "content": "Absolutely amazing course!
