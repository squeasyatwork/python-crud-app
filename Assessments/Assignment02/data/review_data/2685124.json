A LOT\n- Stephen's voice is easy to hear to\n- App development is easy to follow\n- Stephen teaches with: 1) His own Words - 2) Live Diagrams - 3) Clear code (Yes, all three)\n- He teaches slow enough for beginners and fast enough for experienced developers\n- His courses do not suffer from video cuts due to lack of preparation\n- This course also includes many of his typescript course, so its TWO COURSES FOR ONE\n- I learned a lot from his courses (This is not the first one I bought) and I made a lot of money thanks to it.\n- I am loyal to all of his courses, for ever\n\nDisclaimer: I do not know him, I never spoke to him, I was not paid to do this review.

COURSE... EVER... Buy it as many times as you need it. you will NEVER regret it. <br>I have previously bought other Angular courses from OTHER instructors. The all sucked (Specially than Maximilian one :puke: ) but Stephen's is the BEST one out there, BY FAR!</p>\n\n<p>Why is that? Let me tell you:<br>- You can EASILY tell Stephen works in real-world applications<br>- He has A LOT of knowledge. A LOT<br>- Stephen's voice is easy to hear to<br>- App development is easy to follow<br>- Stephen teaches with: 1) His own Words - 2) Live Diagrams - 3) Clear code (Yes, all three)<br>- He teaches slow enough for beginners and fast enough for experienced developers<br>- His courses do not suffer from video cuts due to lack of preparation<br>- This course also includes many of his typescript course, so its TWO COURSES FOR ONE<br>- I learned a lot from his courses (This is not the first one I bought) and I made a lot of money thanks to it.<br>- I am loyal to all of his courses, for ever</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I do not know him, I never spoke to him, I was not paid to do this review.
