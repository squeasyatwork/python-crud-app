He explains and demonstrates in great detail and in small pieces, and then has his students practice that little piece. Gradually, he builds up the pieces into bigger pieces in the practices. </p>\n\n<p>So many instructors do the opposite - they talk and demonstrate a whole ton of things and then give a practice to include all of that. The result is usually one of confusion and frustration on the part of students because it is too hard to put so many things together when you are just beginning. You have difficulty figuring out what is causing the whole thing not to work properly - is it one thing or is it a combination of mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>Kalob - you are a natural teacher - and such people don't come along all the time.

All good so far.\n\nMy early part of the course feedback would be that if, as I did, you already took Kalob's HTML5 course there is some repetition at the beginning of material that was covered in that course like basic CSS syntax and examples and picking an editor.\nStudent time could be saved by simply saying \"If you did my HTML5 course then I covered this already, so you can skip over lectures 2, 3 and 4 (or whatever) - but that's only at the very beginning.\n\nI've found the course excellent as it's gone on further.  There sure is a lot of CSS to learn - but Kalob makes a good job of getting us through it.\nI think the one thing I found most difficult was estimating how long it would take me to do the course.  I allowed about 3 x the video time, but that proved a significant under-estimate.  This is a problem if you are working to a deadline (as I am) and have told my boss I need 3 days to do the course.
