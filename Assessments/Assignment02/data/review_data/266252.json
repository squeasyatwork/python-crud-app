Still not sure why it works, changing the name to topico.php, but it does. \n\nAfter completing the course, I have to say that projects 8 & 9 seriously affected my rating of the course.  I spent almost as much time troubleshooting things on them as I did doing the projects.  As the course is getting somewhat dated now, it might be nice to include some information at the start of the course that lets people know that parts of the course are not compatible with current versions of PHP, Bootstrap, CodeIgniter & CakePHP.  Some info about how they can setup a downgraded environment might enable people to complete the projects with a bit less frustration.\n\nI also didn't like Brad's decision to tour as many frameworks as possible.

The instructor does a good job of telling you just what you need to know to build on each step along the way. I thought the projects were good choices, confident and easily understood. He shows good coding without going into too much detail. Anything.
