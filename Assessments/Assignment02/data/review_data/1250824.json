So you can end up with Laravel 5.8 and Bootstrap 4, which don't work in the same way as Laravel 5.4 and Bootstrap 3.

This is really annoying and surprising as at least as many people will be using a Mac as a PC.\n\n3) Brad doesn't answer questions, and the Eduonix TAs aren't up to scratch. Maybe they're not being paid very much, but just directing people to stackoverflow questions isn't helpful. \n\n4) He uses xammpp with phpmyadmin. Why not use the laravel homestead vagrant environment and MySQL workbench, which aren't that hard to set up, and are more likely to be used in a commecial situation? Brad has a really good intro video on MySQL server and Workbench on youtube. It would be better if he incorporated it into this course.\n\n5) I don't know if this improves on later projects, but Brad gives very little in the way of explanation of how things work or the concepts behind them. I've read this criticism of his teaching style in reviews and I've found it to be true. Yes, you can consult the docs for each new thing, but you shouldn't have to. It's not very hard to video yourself coding a project you've already created, it is hard to clearly explain how each bit works as you're doing it, and this doesn't happen.\n\nI've done other web dev Udemy courses by people like Colt Steele, Stephen Grider and Jonas Scmedtmann, and they all update their courses regularly and provide detailed conceptual explanations of how the code works.
