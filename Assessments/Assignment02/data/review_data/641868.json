So will this course. No course is perfect. As neither is this.\n\nHowever, I really enjoyed it. You will learn the fundamentals of Docker and, at the same time, you will get an environment comprising various tools that will let you deploy to staging and production servers. This environment really works, allowing you to customize it further as you may wish, and letting you do real worker when you're ready. This is really great.\n\nAs various tools are used (ssh, systemd, git, docker, postgresql, redis, flask, nginx), you should expect spending some time if you aren't acquainted to some of these technologies, as I wasn't, although the author does describe some of them as much as required to make all work.\nI would recommend getting some good cheat sheets on git, docker, ..., and following the course closely to get things working first. Later you may gradually change what you want or need, as I found troubleshooting things difficult in docker containers . You may find that \"docker logs <container>\" will be your friend. That git commit --allow-empty -m \"To force push\" may be helpful if you need to push things again (new server, or when images are deleted).
