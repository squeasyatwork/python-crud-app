And lucky for me, this course was released as soon as I finished that one. It was great timing because I was looking to move into more advance WordPress topics.\n\nUltimate WordPress Plugin Course indeed a fantastic course. \n\nGood stuff:\n\n- I learned a lot on what goes into developing plugins and how they\u2019re structured. Like usage of various hooks, shortcodes, filters and interacting with the WP database.\n- Learned about integrating other plugins with our own plugin, using frameworks like jQuery to do certain tasks.\n- The complete workflow. From laying out the basic directory structure to submitting the plugin to WP plugin directory.\n- Joel is an energetic instructor. And he\u2019s actively involved in the discussions answering questions and updating/adding content to the course.\n\nThings that can be improved:\n\n- Personally I\u2019m not a big fan of copying and pasting big chunks of code and going over them method. I prefer the instructor coding alongside me as I tend to understand more what really happens in the code. Another plus point is it reduces room for error on students part because it\u2019s easy to mistype something or miss something while copying lots of code at once. Also in certain lectures,\n- More explaining as to why you write something (why pass this value as this parameter etc) instead simply reading the code.\n- More preparedness.

And lucky for me, this course was released as soon as I finished that one. It was great timing because I was looking to move into more advance WordPress topics.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimate WordPress Plugin Course indeed a fantastic course. </p>\n\n<p>Good stuff:</p>\n\n<p>- I learned a lot on what goes into developing plugins and how they\u2019re structured. Like usage of various hooks, shortcodes, filters and interacting with the WP database.<br>- Learned about integrating other plugins with our own plugin, using frameworks like jQuery to do certain tasks.<br>- The complete workflow. From laying out the basic directory structure to submitting the plugin to WP plugin directory.<br>- Joel is an energetic instructor. And he\u2019s actively involved in the discussions answering questions and updating/adding content to the course.</p>\n\n<p>Things that can be improved:</p>\n\n<p>- Personally I\u2019m not a big fan of copying and pasting big chunks of code and going over them method. I prefer the instructor coding alongside me as I tend to understand more what really happens in the code. Another plus point is it reduces room for error on students part because it\u2019s easy to mistype something or miss something while copying lots of code at once. Also in certain lectures,<br>- More explaining as to why you write something (why pass this value as this parameter etc) instead simply reading the code.<br>- More preparedness.

A lot of students enjoy this lecture style but I understand it's not everyone's cup of tea. All that to say, I appreciate you giving the course a shot and there's no hard feelings if you'd like to request a refund.</p>\n\n<p>Happy coding friend!</p>\n\n<p>~ Joel</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, "content_html": "<p>I know something about the development of plugins and I can say that it is very weak and poorly explained only with copy paste without other concrete examples</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 18053468, "content": "So far everything is entirely clear and no step is skipped.

And he is really engaging, supportive and responsive on this course. I appreciated the fact that he replied back on all my questions. He is also doing a good job on delivering what he knows with his way of doing things. \n\nHowever, this course might be better labeled as an introduction to a bit more advanced use of Wordpress, mostly as practicing for WP Designers, Marketers or Entrepreneurs who have already the basic knowledge of the standard Web technologies like html, js and php, to help them get more familiar with writing some code inside the WP platform and to gain confidence using all these. It can be considered as the next step, or a good exercise for an advanced WP user, but it should not be the final point of reference for someone who really wants to learn best practices and how to code with high quality standards. \n\nIn my opinion this is not a course for PHP or \"Wordpress\" developers, as it will not make them better Coders or WP plugin developers, apart of the basic familiarity with WP as described above.\n\nI have to admit that after a point and later I had to skip a lot of the lessons, as I was not getting more knowledge or new things. Some of the other issues with this course are mentioned by other students' comments. \n\nI also want to suggest that even for this kind of course, there could be a few things done better:\n - a plan of what we do and why\n - deeper explanations on the topics covered\n - a few more tips (e.g. debugging)\n - usage of better practices (e.g. writing secure code)\n - more \"real-time trial, error and fix\", instead of pasting a bunch of functions and wait too long to see how these finally work.\n - less focus on adding more features for the plugin that got us in writing, and writing custom simple php things, and more focus on using WP API stuff.\n\nStill, I appreciate Joel's efforts and everything this course had to offer and really hope my review will help Joel improve both in terms of creating his courses, or even becoming a better WP plugin developer.\n\nAnd finally, did I say that Joel is a decent guy?", "rating": 3.5, "created": "2018-02-10T06:04:31Z", "modified": "2018-05-22T15:22:01Z", "user_modified": "2018-02-20T22:03:22Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 3160142, "title": "Ioannis Tsimpidis", "name": "Ioannis", "display_name": "Ioannis Tsimpidis", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "IT"}, "response": {"_class": "course_review_response", "id": 1147094, "content": "Hi Ioannis,\n\nThanks for thorough review of the course and the valuable suggestions.

I appreciated the fact that he replied back on all my questions. He is also doing a good job on delivering what he knows with his way of doing things. </p>\n\n<p>However, this course might be better labeled as an introduction to a bit more advanced use of Wordpress, mostly as practicing for WP Designers, Marketers or Entrepreneurs who have already the basic knowledge of the standard Web technologies like html, js and php, to help them get more familiar with writing some code inside the WP platform and to gain confidence using all these. It can be considered as the next step, or a good exercise for an advanced WP user, but it should not be the final point of reference for someone who really wants to learn best practices and how to code with high quality standards. </p>\n\n<p>In my opinion this is not a course for PHP or \"Wordpress\" developers, as it will not make them better Coders or WP plugin developers, apart of the basic familiarity with WP as described above.</p>\n\n<p>I have to admit that after a point and later I had to skip a lot of the lessons, as I was not getting more knowledge or new things. Some of the other issues with this course are mentioned by other students' comments. </p>\n\n<p>I also want to suggest that even for this kind of course, there could be a few things done better:<br> - a plan of what we do and why<br> - deeper explanations on the topics covered<br> - a few more tips (e.g. debugging)<br> - usage of better practices (e.g. writing secure code)<br> - more \"real-time trial, error and fix\", instead of pasting a bunch of functions and wait too long to see how these finally work.<br> - less focus on adding more features for the plugin that got us in writing, and writing custom simple php things, and more focus on using WP API stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Still, I appreciate Joel's efforts and everything this course had to offer and really hope my review will help Joel improve both in terms of creating his courses, or even becoming a better WP plugin developer.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, did I say that Joel is a decent guy?</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 58606366, "content": "Very enlightening!
