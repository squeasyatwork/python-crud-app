I installed  Symfony using instructor's instructions.  Being one year later I didn't realize there was a Symfony 5 that went out in the meanwhile and I would be tempted to say I downloaded latest version and it's indeed the case. By following his instructions I got Symfony 5.1 instead of 4. I realized a bit later where stuff started being a tad different. that I didnt have the same version.  So I guess I should blame myself for getting wrong version and the teacher doesnt have to update course for silly people like me using version 5. Well some other instructors upgrade their course to keep up to date for future students and it's good for both old buyers and potential new students who are not buying something too old. But thing is I got version 5 by following his instructions which are clearly not future proof because composer allows user to specify version. I am adding a star because I actually appreciated teacher getting in details on topic that tutorials usually just skim. But thing is it comes at the cost of teacher skimming on topic he considered not requiring not much explanation, like the twig code to add stylesheet  and js on page.  To be honest I didnt care much because I have used Symfony in the past and those are mundane things that I am glad I didnt have to waste time on again but I am thinking of people learning Symfony... While in other courses like with  Maximillian Schwartzmuller the instructor types code as it goes and explains what he is doing. Here the instructor is  either 1) have typed config lines beforehand and just comments it out for the video (At beginning I was wondering why I didnt have those lines it's rather an unsettling thing to do and the guy  doesn't bother giving an explanation). Then for the first bootstrap template guy just has you copy paste the twig template from his file and as said i's a good thing for old timers but not that good for newcomers because how to appropriate twig if not typing stuff along. Supposedly there is also a file for the css but it's missing and we have to type it this time. There was a lot of stuff I couldnt figure out why it wasnt working in the config file but it was ok because it comes from my version not being version 4. And here my bootstrap template style is not working  and I have no clue why. Teachers spent a whole video on how controller was calling services and I quite liked this thorough study of the inner logic of the framework,  although quite a boring theoritical thing to start off a tutorial with for a beginner! But for the use of Webpack, the description of what it does and how it works is pretty vague. And I know I can't count on the teacher being around for students to help so I will look it up online as it must be quite a documented topic and faster than downgrading Symfony to version 4.  To be honest I am pretty sure that going on Sensiolabs website and following their free tutorials would be a better use of my time. And although I still haven't finished the course, I think it's pretty safe to give similar advise to potential buyers who are willing to learn Symfony. You might find there is a shortage of good lessons on this topic on Udemy but there is a lot of material online to learn it, and chances are it will be a better experience for you that this rough ride that are the lessons provided by this teacher.\nIn a nutshell: The teacher doesn't reply and help students and he doesn't keep course updated.
