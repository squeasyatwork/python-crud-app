I'm on a mission to absorb everything I can find on Express and MongoDB/mongoose so when I queried the site for intermediate and expert courses this appeared under intermediate. First I'll point out this isn't technically an intermediate course this is a beginner course on Express. Personally I would think anyone looking to get into Express should understand Node and that they should feel comfortable in Node but that might be me. The first three courses I did watch on maxed playback. \n\nOnto the reason for the rating.\n\n-1 star: The whole course it was mentioned the importance of securing API keys and he even went on to mention in the last video there are scrapers just looking for keys on Github. I think there is a missed opportunity here to teach the importance of env files and how it's important to not push keys to a repo. Even a simple use case for something like dotenv with a .gitignore is better than nothing in Express 101, 201 or 301.\n\n- 1/2 star: This might be due to completing a lot of the other courses or since I've already gone through every LinkedIn course on Node but the repo is just a dump of everything. I would have preferred a branch approach where I could code along and if my code failed I could reference the source files for comparison from that branch. This approach would also help if I ever forget something and need to come back and do a video, for example passport, I could download those starting files and code along with the video. Wouldn't even have to use Github some other authors just provide a file download for that lesson.\n\n-1/2 star: Maybe this is another personal preference but over the time taking the course I recall him mentioning the importance of not overloading a file and separating certain routes. I think this same logic should be applied to middleware. The author dumped all middleware into the same files as the routes when I think it would have been better to create a directory and then require the middleware into the route. I think this is a best practice so feel free to take it as personal preference.\n\nI do like to ask a few questions to see if the author will apply. Some Udemy course I've taken the author is MIA for some time and that can be reflected in the Q&A but the questions I did ask the author responded within 24 hours so that should be noted.

I have learned the most useful information about Node, Express and what goes on behind the scenes of client-server (HTTP, TCP/IP) interactions thus far in my experience as a \"Udemy student\". Great course Robert, I look forward to checking out what else ya got on here. Thank you for the thoughtfulness when providing intro lectures. They truly support learning AND comprehension. This is a much better learning experience than a code along where the instructor just tells us to do something because \"that's what you do in Express\".</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 26895716, "content": "Well organize and easy to follow even though it is a bit fast.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2019-02-04T01:31:16Z", "modified": "2019-02-04T12:02:05Z", "user_modified": "2019-02-04T01:32:46Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 27182504, "title": "Prak Savoeun", "name": "Prak", "display_name": "Prak Savoeun", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/27182504_80a4.jpg", "initials": "PS"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Well organize and easy to follow even though it is a bit fast.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 41584986, "content": "Takes you through the whole process and helps you understand the internal workings.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2019-12-08T07:05:15Z", "modified": "2019-12-08T20:09:40Z", "user_modified": "2019-12-08T07:05:57Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 67010650, "title": "Shravan Reddy", "name": "Shravan", "display_name": "Shravan Reddy", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "SR"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Takes you through the whole process and helps you understand the internal workings.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 62357750, "content": "Nice work on this course.
