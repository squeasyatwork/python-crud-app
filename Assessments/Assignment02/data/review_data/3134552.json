The whole course he copies and pastes code from repo which he copied from eShopOnContainers and tries to explain it with his limited vocabulary.  </p>\n\n<p>His strong accent is hard to understand. To solve this problem he could've added proper subtitles as many students requested, but he didn't. He also makes a lot of elementary-level grammar mistakes which are confusing sometimes. His speech is too slow. I had to use 1.5 or 1.75 speed. </p>\n\n<p>If you are new to microservices I recommend studying the eShopOnContainers repository on GitHub and guide books from that repo. The .NET microservices Path courses on Pluralsight were done much more professionally in terms of tutoring quality.<br>I hope the author will consider all the above and improve the quality of his courses.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 94771394, "content": "This course really easy to understand.
