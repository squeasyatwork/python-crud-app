He's difficult to understand most of the time, and sometimes what he says makes no sense.\n\nIf you can get past that, the next major issue is that the presenter seems to be \"winging it\" through the entire course, and there is no apparent effort made to edit any of the videos, despite the very frequent mistakes. So you get to experience hours of the presenter typing the same code over and over, making the same coding mistakes and typos over and over, and then trying to figure out what he did wrong and how to fix each problem. I'm fine with trial and error when I'm coding my own project from scratch, but for a paid course the excess typing and unedited mistakes were a big waste of my time.\n\nThe teaching ideology of this course seems to be that if you type it over and over, you will learn it. This is helpful for the first half of the course where Shahzaib shows you how to use a lot of useful Bootstrap components, but there is very little time spent actually teaching the fundamental what's, how's and why's of Bootstrap. I guess his assumption is that you don't need to really know anything about Bootstrap as long as you know the basic classes and where to use them in your code. This is my second Bootstrap course, and after completing 100% of the course, I definitely still do not feel like a \"Bootstrap Master\". \n\nLastly, the quality of the web pages being created in these projects would not acceptable for professional web designers. The designs are lazy, sloppy and error-ridden. Pages have horizontal scrollbars, they do not all work properly on different size screens (not responsive), there are spacing/padding issues, etc. I discovered late in the course that Shahzaib was actually copying designs that are available as free theme downloads from startbootstrap.com. That might have been fine on it's own, but what you end up with after completing the projects are poorly coded, barely working imitations. I would have been better off just downloading those high quality, professionally made, free themes from the startbootstrap.com website, and trying to learn on my own by going through the HTML code.\n\nThe course wasn't a complete waste of time, but it was a very frustrating how little value it really offered, and how little I got out of it for how much time I invested (about 3 weeks working through it part time). Shahzaib knows Bootstrap and has the potential to offer a good course, but I can't recommend this course until he's fixed these issues and actually invested the time into making a quality and worthwhile course. \nUnfortunately I don't have a better alternative to this course to suggest, other than googling freely available articles and training videos from genuine Bootstrap experts.", "rating": 2.0, "created": "2016-03-04T13:03:27-08:00", "modified": "2016-03-04T21:03:34-08:00", "user_modified": "2016-03-04T21:03:34-08:00", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 18018712, "title": "Adam Tell", "name": "Adam", "display_name": "Adam Tell", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "AT"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>You may learn something if you're an experienced coder, but there are way too many issues with this course to recommend it, whether free or at any price. </p>\n\n<p>The first major hurdle is the presenter's limited English language skills.
