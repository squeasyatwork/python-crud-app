It would require some video editing and more work, but course would be a lot more practical.<br>* implementing a hamburger lesson - it's a rather a CSS lesson, code could be already there, author could spend some time explaining how it works and then explain it from accessibility point of view.<br>* same as above for an \"accessible javascript part 3\" - the lesson is too long to begin with, and it's 90% javascript lesson and 10% accessibility. Again I think code could be pasted or video-edited while author would explain accessibility concepts. It can be 20 min lesson at most.<br>* there were some inconsistencies like author telling viewers not to use id's for styling but at the same time doing it, or telling you should never use a \"title\" attribute in one lesson then on the next one saying you should use it for iframes.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "10 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 84818060, "content": "Both issues identified and recommended changes.", "rating": 4.0, "created": "2021-05-13T01:22:17Z", "modified": "2021-05-14T16:05:52Z", "user_modified": "2021-05-13T01:22:57Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 85939934, "title": "BhanuMurthy Kota", "name": "BhanuMurthy", "display_name": "BhanuMurthy Kota", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "BK"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Both issues identified and recommended changes.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 80367266, "content": "Easy to follow, covers the topic.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2021-03-18T09:54:03Z", "modified": "2021-03-19T16:05:51Z", "user_modified": "2021-03-18T09:54:45Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 41855214, "title": "Elke B\u00f6vers", "name": "Elke", "display_name": "Elke B\u00f6vers", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "EB"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Easy to follow, covers the topic.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "6 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 96778808, "content": "Good to Learn", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2021-09-30T07:07:45Z", "modified": "2021-10-01T16:05:55Z", "user_modified": "2021-09-30T07:07:58Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 173979848, "title": "", "name": "", "display_name": "Venkatesh S5", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": ""}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Good to Learn</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a week ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 78437284, "content": "s\u00ed, excelente elecxccion", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2021-02-22T10:23:45Z", "modified": "2021-02-24T13:42:38Z", "user_modified": "2021-02-24T13:42:38Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 91502690, "title": "Ariel Ferro", "name": "Ariel", "display_name": "Ariel Ferro", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "AF"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>s\u00ed, excelente elecxccion</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "7 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 52764438, "content": "Too basic.", "rating": 2.5, "created": "2020-04-27T03:05:28Z", "modified": "2020-04-27T09:04:40Z", "user_modified": "2020-04-27T03:05:45Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 5034866, "title": "Alan Fidelino", "name": "Alan", "display_name": "Alan Fidelino", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/5034866_4d60.jpg", "initials": "AF"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Too basic.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 38180104, "content": "Nice course!
