One key lesson of this course is to run a js script file AFTER an html page is loaded. Their code works in their videos but when I run the same code in the same browser on my PC the script will always run before loading the page. I asked the instructor about this, got an answer from the assistant instructor saying he was \"stumped\" by this behavior (he actually reproduce it on his side), he did not know how to fix it. I wonder how often they review their courses to check if they are still compatible with latest browser version. Now I know why the course was on sale for $21, I will not ask for refund and keep it as general programming reference.  But would not rely on this as a learning tool.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 66795582, "content": "It's good learning Experience now i

will NOT allow you to get a job right after completing it.\n- This course will NOT allow you to create a webapp on the same level as Instagram, twitch, etc. (at least not this course alone)\n\nBUT, you notice I still gave it 5 stars.\n\nThat's because what this course WILL do is:\n\n- Teach you the basic barebones of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python (including bootstrap and jquery).\n- Teach you how to use Django to build a website/webapp with user accounts.\n- Teach you how to incorporate HTML, CSS, and Javascript into Django on these websites.\n- Introduce you to an instructor who really knows what he's doing, willing to make mistakes and work through them, help his students along the way, and even add new content.\n\nSo, you might be asking yourself, who is this course for?\n\nThis course is for beginners to intermediate programmers who want to start learning how to build a web app. It's for people who are not afraid to look things up and learn on their own. \n\nJose teaches the fundamentals, but he also helps you learn how to go about looking things up, referencing the documentation, and more.\n\nI went into this course because I am determined to build a web app for my company and Django seemed like the best route. I leave this course with the knowledge to start my project and get through at least a prototype I can then pass along. Did I learn everything I need? No, but I learned enough to know it can be done, and how to find information on the things I haven't yet learned.\n\nIt was an amazing course and he keeps adding more.

The clone projects at the end are much encompassing. The amount of detail he teaches is great. The voice is very comfortable to listen to. He does go quite fast but I actually like that. It really forces you to learn to type fast and when that fails there's always the pause button. I highly recommend using the pause button. He used bootstrap3 for his styling in the projects. I tried to incorporate bootstrap4 in my projects when running parallel to him. That was a fun challenge. It's actually not that difficult. You just gotta read the docs and see how the styling and classes are supposed to be. I did really find one thing quite annoying, to be honest. From previous coding experience, which was mostly personal projects and a coding bootcamp, you always code a bit then see how your site is looking. Code some more, check out the site/app. Aka kinda test-driven development. Now, this is only functional testing/integration testing and not really unit testing but still. You should be trying to do some kind of test-driven development. This guy pretty much writes the code from 0 to 98 then starts up the server to see how things work and only then starts debugging. I'm not a pro but I'm not sure that's the best workflow. That's why deducted half a star. It would really be helpful if how in the beginning he showed the end product and during the actual process, you could see visually the functionality we're working on at the moment. I understand often that's not possible because lots of things are intertwined together. Most of the things you could do that though in my humble opinion. Again I'm just a student yet but... That one thing I think could be improved. Most people are very visual learners. Overall great course though. Would highly recommend it to others. Definitely code along and try to do certain things your own way. Like I used pipenv for my virtual environment. I liked that workflow much better. Also bootstrap4 as well as VSCode as my editor of choice.

The clone projects at the end are much encompassing. The amount of detail he teaches is great. The voice is very comfortable to listen to. He does go quite fast but I actually like that. It really forces you to learn to type fast and when that fails there's always the pause button. I highly recommend using the pause button. He used bootstrap3 for his styling in the projects. I tried to incorporate bootstrap4 in my projects when running parallel to him. That was a fun challenge. It's actually not that difficult. You just gotta read the docs and see how the styling and classes are supposed to be. I did really find one thing quite annoying, to be honest. From previous coding experience, which was mostly personal projects and a coding bootcamp, you always code a bit then see how your site is looking. Code some more, check out the site/app. Aka kinda test-driven development. Now, this is only functional testing/integration testing and not really unit testing but still. You should be trying to do some kind of test-driven development. This guy pretty much writes the code from 0 to 98 then starts up the server to see how things work and only then starts debugging. I'm not a pro but I'm not sure that's the best workflow. That's why deducted half a star. It would really be helpful if how in the beginning he showed the end product and during the actual process, you could see visually the functionality we're working on at the moment. I understand often that's not possible because lots of things are intertwined together. Most of the things you could do that though in my humble opinion. Again I'm just a student yet but... That one thing I think could be improved. Most people are very visual learners. Overall great course though. Would highly recommend it to others.

This is extremely confusing to people like me who aren't 100% sure how to go about creating a new site. Jose, if you're reading this - CHOOSE ONE template directory structure and stick to it. \n\nHowever, all of the above is not a big deal, probably still warrants a 4.5 rating.\n\nThe worst part about this class is that it is extremely outdated, even though it's only been 1.5 years.\n\nWhat's outdated?\n1) Django 1 is taught in the class, now Django 2 resolved a LOT of issues that were in Django 1. For example, you no longer need to use regular expressions in the URLs.py file. That saves a crap ton of time debugging as most of us python beginners do NOT understand regular expressions at all.\n\n2) A lot of modules have had their names changed. Not the biggest deal, but it will get you stuck and add to your debug time.\n\n3) Bootstrap 3 is taught in the class, while Bootstrap 4 is now widely available. Not as huge of a difference as above, but still, you're basically stuck either learning an outdated css style or having to lookup your own Bootstrap 4 tags.\n\nHonestly, this entire class can be taught in 10 hours if the material is presented in a better way, and also if the information wasn't so outdated. There are way better tutorials online that cover bootstrap 4 and django 2.1.\n\nIf you completely don't know anything about python I'd still recommend this class, but if you already know a little python and just want to make your own website using Django asap, don't take this class because there are far better, more updated (and FREE) options out on Youtube.\n\nOverall, I still enjoy this instructor's courses a lot, but the outdated nature of this course is a full -2 stars.", "rating": 2.5, "created": "2018-10-07T15:34:02Z", "modified": "2018-10-08T08:02:48Z", "user_modified": "2018-10-07T15:48:07Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 52847042, "title": "Lionel Yu", "name": "Lionel", "display_name": "Lionel Yu", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "LY"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Generally I've enjoyed this instructor's classes but this course is pretty outdated.
