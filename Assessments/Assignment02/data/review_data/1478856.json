I definitely recommend it and I would rate it 19/20.\n\nAbout two years ago I was learning HTML & CSS for the first time in my life in an in-person course at the university. It went really fast and everything was rushed because the curriculum was more inclined towards teaching traditional Back End technologies related to Microsoft and Oracle. We were supposed to have learned HTML & CSS in just two months. The result of this hurry was awful and most of us had to rely exclusively on Bootstrap to try to mock-up websites. I eventually quit that career because I couldn't keep up the pace. I then tried starting from scratch and reviewing HTML & CSS by myself with the help of online documentation and exercises, using platforms such as W3Schools and FreeCodeCamp. I got somewhat better in HTML & CSS, around 25% I would say. But still, I was far from being able to code the mockup of a website on my own. I thought it was exclusively my fault and that I wasn't meant for it. But I didn't give up yet and tried again through Udemy and I enrolled in John Smilga's course.\n\nThe first great thing about John's course is that he doesn't rush anything. He takes the amount of time and content that both HTML & CSS deserve. At universities and coding bootcamps these topics are rushed supposedly because of being easy or not as important, and you're just left with an overview. You're able to answer questions and take theoretical exams about it, but you can't actually take on a real project by yourself. In Udemy I learned much more than at university and external documentation platforms together. John takes the time to explain each concept, and also you get to practice most of the concepts over and over again through practical projects. After John's course, I estimate my progress from 25% to around 80%. I must say however that I actually took two Udemy courses on the subject. I made the first half of John's, then went through the other one from start to finish, and finally came back to complete the remaining half.\n\nJohn's course theoretical part is already pretty good because it's really complete. But the mini-projects and full-projects parts were even better, and those are the ones that really took me from a beginner level to an intermediate-advanced level. I now feel that I can take on a full Home Page project all on my own (regarding HTML & CSS). I have also a good understanding of relative/absolute positioning, flexbox, and grid, which were confusing and daunting topics back when I started. Back when I started this course I felt that the course needed a bit more mini-projects because it jumped right away from theoretical demonstrations to very large projects. However, the addition of the Grid Mini Projects and Additional Projects section was absolutely great. I was able to do understand and code myself about 90% of the additional projects (on average) at the end of the course, needing only to peek at the solution videos for the remaining 10%.\n\nApart from the very positive project-oriented style by itself. Another very great thing about the course is that John posts the final working website of the projects, which is an absolute great help because it allows you to try the upcoming lectures as challenges and try to do as much as you can yourself before going through the entire lecture without understanding where are we aiming at. It's evident that there is great planning and preparation of projects beforehand from the very start, instead of what some instructors do which is just planning one lecture ahead and bouncing back and forth within the lectures about the content and appearance of the end result.\n\nYet two other great things about this course are that:1) John is creating new and updated content continuously. When I came back to complete the second half of the course, a lot of it was updated and there were also many new sections, and 2) John is active in the Question & Answers section and he has replied to my questions whenever I posted one.\n\nThere's still, however, some content that I believe this course should include and is somehow missing: Yet another simple mini-projects section in the middle of the CSS theoretical chapters (Sections 4 to 14). I believe that there is too much straight time invested in the CSS fundamentals and properties without an actual simple application. And once you finally complete all those sections, the Tea Station project (don't get me wrong, it is an absolutely great project) is still very demanding at that point in the course. The final Additional Projects section is great for students that have gone through all the chapters and know Grid and Flexbox by then, but there should be a simpler Mini-Projects section that should require neither Flexbox nor Grid by the middle of the CSS theoretical chapters, in order to apply and internalize the fundamental CSS properties before facing all of a sudden such a large project as the Tea Station.\n\nOther than that, the structure, pace, content, and projects are absolutely great and I definitely recommend this course.
