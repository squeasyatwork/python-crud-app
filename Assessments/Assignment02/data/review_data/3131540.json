His content and delivery is excellent, in my opinion, and I signed up for this course immediately when he announced it. I had not used Udemy before, and I have since signed up for several of his other courses and some by others, entirely as a result of my positive experience with this course.\n\nCompared with other courses, this one is quite short, because there is only so much to learn about Electron, at the end of the day. There is obviously a fair quantity of repetition over the three projects, but in a hands on course I think this is precisely what is needed. \n\nAs always, Brad's delivery is down to earth and clear. Unlike some others, he doesn't come across as patronising when explaining the simple stuff, and he is aware of the range of knowledge his students will have when he covers more complex elements.\n\nThe only criticisms I have are not significant enough to detract from a well-deserved 5 star rating. However, I would have valued some comments (if not necessarily instruction) around the difference between the release builds that are generated in this project (folders with tons of content and an .exe file) and the installers that one typically experiences when using an officially developed app. For example, when downloading VS Code, you download it as an installer. On researching it, I can see that there are packagers for this purpose and that there may be complications around certification etc, but it would have made the course more complete it it was addressed, in my opinion.
