The instructor often inclines towards what he wants and not what will give the most value to the students. \nMost applications these days will be built as APIs and the clients will be built with more mature frontend frameworks like React, Vue or Angular. But the instructor goes for the more traditional approach of building applications using bootstrap and vanilla JS. Not bad for fundamentals but that totally deviates from what the course is supposed to offer, i.e Go.\n\nThis course could have been much better if it focussed on building APIs in GO and the instructor used a REST API client e.g postman, thunder, insomnia or whichever other. After building the APIs, the course could have then built the webpages to consume it. But now all that html, csss and js monotony is strewn in the middle and skipping it means you will have to give up on any go tips and tricks in there - yet going through the whole thing is extremely tiring.\n\nThe instructor goes on to choose postgres yet mysql has a bigger audience and all the time I am just hoping that he would give us more reasons as to why he is opting for Postgres. Not that I hate these technologies but if I buy a course and the lecturer is opting for a tech, I would love to know the merits it brings and what I stand to lose or gain if I choose one over the other. I dont want to use Postgres simply because, \"Thats what I want to use\". I also dont want to use DBeaver, which has one of the worst UIs ever, unless it offers certain advantages. This wouldn't bother me if the instructor would just indicate that we use whatever we want as long as we can view our DBs. But he doesnt do that, he goes through the process of installing and setting up, which is again monotonous.\n\nThe instructor is knowledgable and honestly he has jokes, puns and sarcasm that had me laughing more than once.

The instructor often inclines towards what he wants and not what will give the most value to the students. <br>Most applications these days will be built as APIs and the clients will be built with more mature frontend frameworks like React, Vue or Angular. But the instructor goes for the more traditional approach of building applications using bootstrap and vanilla JS. Not bad for fundamentals but that totally deviates from what the course is supposed to offer, i.e Go.</p>\n\n<p>This course could have been much better if it focussed on building APIs in GO and the instructor used a REST API client e.g postman, thunder, insomnia or whichever other. After building the APIs, the course could have then built the webpages to consume it. But now all that html, csss and js monotony is strewn in the middle and skipping it means you will have to give up on any go tips and tricks in there - yet going through the whole thing is extremely tiring.</p>\n\n<p>The instructor goes on to choose postgres yet mysql has a bigger audience and all the time I am just hoping that he would give us more reasons as to why he is opting for Postgres. Not that I hate these technologies but if I buy a course and the lecturer is opting for a tech, I would love to know the merits it brings and what I stand to lose or gain if I choose one over the other. I dont want to use Postgres simply because, \"Thats what I want to use\". I also dont want to use DBeaver, which has one of the worst UIs ever, unless it offers certain advantages.
