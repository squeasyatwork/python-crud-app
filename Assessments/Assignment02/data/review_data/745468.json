I repeat.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder why the teacher does not pay attention to all these details but important issues?!!!! Students want to learn something and so annoyed, frustrated by NO-ERGONOMIC factors like that!!!!</p>\n\n<p>Redo your course smoother, and you will get 5 stars.</p>\n\n<p>Version 2 of the review:</p>\n\n<p>I go forward in the course, the good point of the course is it connects the dot, we see how different technologies assembled, besides JS, we also see how AngularJS is used.  I understand perfectly that it needs another course/tutorial on AngularJS to understand better what Le explained, but it's OK to give a spoon of AngularJS to taste.</p>\n\n<p>I still have same assessment on the course:<br>- Good: Practical course, connect the dots<br>- Bad: Distracting music makes broken English hard to understand (don't get me wrong, I have same name Le as the teacher, no discrimination here, just a very friendly observation)</p>\n\n<p>I raise my assessment to 3.5 stars, because  practical, connecting-dot courses are rare.  The effort to introduce new technology like AngularJS is meritorious.

With prior background in Java, this course was just what I needed to get my feet wet with Java Spring Framework and AngularJS. I liked the fact that the instructor does not take shortcuts and starts with a simple concept that he continues to build upon. I highly recommend it anyone who wants to start doing web application development.<br>The instructor really knows a lot about Spring Framework and is very helpful in assisting whenever I got stuck.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "5 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 5737644, "content": "best tutorial ever", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2017-03-01T11:38:10Z", "modified": "2017-03-01T19:38:10Z", "user_modified": "2017-03-01T19:38:10Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 24067618, "title": "Kb", "name": "Kb", "display_name": "Kb", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "K"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>best tutorial ever</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 5926288, "content": "I liked this tutorial from scratch, it is a good start to understand spring framework", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2017-03-13T04:36:09Z", "modified": "2017-03-13T11:36:09Z", "user_modified": "2017-03-13T11:36:09Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 7106824, "title": "Andrei Rotari", "name": "Andrei", "display_name": "Andrei Rotari", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "AR"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>I liked this tutorial from scratch, it is a good start to understand spring framework</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 4573434, "content": "The best course on udemy!", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2016-12-21T13:37:07Z", "modified": "2016-12-21T21:37:07Z", "user_modified": "2016-12-21T21:37:07Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 14543208, "title": "\u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433 \u0421\u0442\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0432", "name": "\u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433", "display_name": "\u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433 \u0421\u0442\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0432", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": ""}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>The best course on udemy!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 5332632, "content": "Course is very good.
