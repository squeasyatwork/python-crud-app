My only issue with the course is that, while it definitely would benefit beginners, I personal feeling is that utilizing Emmet's autofill function takes away from complete novices.  If you have to actually type out every single line of code, character by character, you learn the syntax more completely (like with the needed link tag attributes, for example).
