Let us go one by one. Course content is great, if you are new and do not know anything about MVC then great way to start. Each lessons are explained with small stand alone applications so that even if you are stuck in one you can come back and start new lesson without break. (I have scene courses where just to explain new concept people say \"import dll built in lesson 6 (what if lesson 6 was not completed by you? One have to go all the way to build that dll and come back to current lesson\"). So no tight coupling :-)\n\nNow coming to project included. It is a basic project but Author has used everything that is used in professional ones.

I feel that we can avoid Jquery/Javascript codes in calling apis. It is good for intermediates but a complete beginner looses his/her interest.

I know the tool is excellent, but it's new version (9.0.0 or something) is not that helpful and fails randomely. So for a beginner it is tough to understand the error and solve it, and this is where most students loose interest in the course. It took me a whole night to reverse engineer the project and build it without AutoMapper. (This is when I came to know how useful the tool is). However There could be one small lecture included that how can u map ViewModel to Model or vice Versa without Auto Mapper. That would be helpful for beginners.\n\n3. Project lecture ends abruptly after \"Create a question\". Edit and Delete questions are skipped. Author could have given those as assignments with code and hints.
