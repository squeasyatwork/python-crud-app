You won't find this content anywhere else on Udemy, and will have a tough time finding a lot of it on the internet. HIT THAT PURCHASE BUTTON--YOU WON'T REGRET IT. (Yes--I'm shouting at you--the course is THAT GOOD! If I could give it 10 stars, I would.) Course just launched in late Sept. 2020, so it's just starting, obviously!  A teaser of what section 1 videos include: unique page loader progress icons, custom gradient scrollbars, shape dividers to partition off sections of your SPA (no more boring horizontal lines...), animated buttons that don't make you gag, animated menu reveal when a hamburger icon is clicked...and that's just the beginning. Content will be driven by both Rahul and you--what did you always want to know how to build? Submit the idea--most popular ones will be prioritized ;-)\n\nI have taken 2 of Rahul's other CSS courses, and the quality of content just blows you away--can't recommend them highly enough. If you want your site to be memorable in a GOOD WAY, this course is a must-have. He has AMAZING visual design skills--up in the top 1% of designers. Cool stuff that actually is applicable, not just cool effects for effects sake. Check out his CSS Shapes course as well as the Advanced CSS Selectors--you'll walk away with absolutely BOMB quality techniques! I have been working with CSS for 20 years, and have found explanations from him that finally have cleared up the mystery of little-used but powerful selectors/techniques.  Rahul will make you a \"power user\" of CSS-you'll be very happy he is generously sharing his expertise with you. (My only suggestion is to watch the videos at a slower speed-he speaks quickly--but he's totally understandable.) Rahul is very responsive in the Q & A as well--you won't be left hanging, unlike some courses.\n\nThis continuing \"series\" of hard to do/update old sites with new techniques weekly topics course is an AWESOME IDEA! Will update this review further after working through the projects--but for now, am rarin' to go implement them myself! Join me and others--this can be an awesome ongoing forum for dynamic design! \n\nKEEP 'EM COMING, RAHUL!!!!!!", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2020-09-29T16:23:24Z", "modified": "2020-10-03T15:30:33Z", "user_modified": "2020-10-03T15:30:33Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 59485653, "title": "Tami Schultz", "name": "Tami", "display_name": "Tami Schultz", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/59485653_5c34_4.jpg", "initials": "TS"}, "response": {"_class": "course_review_response", "id": 6193604, "content": "Okay, so you (literally) blew my mind, Tami. it's so relaxing to see such an in-depth review, you're one of my star students,  wait for Friday video, that will blow your mind. anyway, thanks again for the shoutout <3", "created": "2020-09-30T11:50:08Z", "modified": "2020-09-30T11:52:50Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 7693070, "title": "Rahul Giri", "name": "Rahul", "display_name": "Rahul Giri", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/7693070_3be9_5.jpg", "initials": "RG"}, "content_html": "<p>Okay, so you (literally) blew my mind, Tami. it's so relaxing to see such an in-depth review, you're one of my star students,  wait for Friday video, that will blow your mind. anyway, thanks again for the shoutout <3</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, "content_html": "<p>Hey all, get ready to BLAST OFF on an incredible creative journey!
