Sections 1 through 4 were high-level overviews of the technologies (Node, Express, React, Redux, React Router) as well as some nice theoretical context around universal JavaScript.\n\nSection 3 was a minor disappointment. The instructor quickly walked through a simple example application. There was mostly copy/pasting with little explanation of the example code, which was fine given the simplicity of the example and my hope that there would be more detail in later sections.\n\nSection 5 was a major disappointment. Instead of walking through the iterative process of building a more complex sample application\u2014explaining along the way how the different pieces work together or why they're being put them together one way vs. another\u2014it amounted to forking a readymade application from GitHub and watching 5 short summary videos. There was no discussion around development process, project structure, code reusability, etc. Additionally, the last example application used an outdated version of React Router and there was some unexplained/unused code in the repository, both of which made it feel unfinished.\n\nSection 6 was a high-level overview of 4 popular universal frameworks with good discussion around the pros and cons of each in addition to some simple demos. It leaves you well informed as to when you might use each framework in the future and why.\n\nOn the whole, I wouldn't recommend this course.
