I have been trying to learn modern Javascript libraries that use virtual DOM's like Vue and React. I was looking for a course that gave some insight on how that worked. This course did exactly that.

A knowledge of ES6 and some ES7 Javascript as the course uses nothing but modern javascript syntax.\n\n2. A basic to intermediate understanding of DOM manipulation as well as how to use the DOM API to create, append and remove dom nodes from the page and\n\n3.
