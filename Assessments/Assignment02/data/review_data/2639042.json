I've never used Gatsby before, and have little React experience, but I've just walked away with a functioning website! The explanations are really clear and the structure of the course is great.\n\nA lot of the code is copied and the author then explains what each line does. You have to pause frequently to get everything down but I found, by listening to the explanation, then pausing and typing everything in one go worked a treat. Plus is makes sense that the author didn't type everything out during each video. If she did, can you imagine how long each video would be?!\n\nTotally disagree with the 2 star comment that's left here which seems to be based on 1 single video from section 1. Section 1 is pretty basic but it's essentially the setup course and, as it obviously isn't a course about SEO, the one video that covers that topic doesn't go deep on the topic because, well, the course is about Gatsby, so why would you expect in depth explanations about the metadata? The author tells you what you need to know to get all the pieces of a website together and I think she does a really good job doing just that. And it's pretty obvious that changing the name on the twitter card to \"summary_large_image\" is simply that... a name change to easily identify the change in the console. If you're after an intermediate course why would you need something so simple explained?\n\nSection 2 is one of my favorites. I've never used GraphQL before but it's incredibly cool! I learned a lot more about the different types of plugins in section 3 (the author DOES go into detail here so maybe Mr 2 star should've watched more than one video) and section 4 it's lots of fun as you really get into the meat of Gatsby and learn how to programmatically create pages.\n\nIn the final 3 sections the author goes over how to optimize images on your Gatsby site and then switches from markdown files to a CMS in section 6. I've never used Contentful before but I'm definitely a fan of how easy it is to use with Gatsby. Finally, in the last section, the author walked through deploying the site on Netlify, which is incredibly simple.\n\nDefinitely recommend this course to anyone who is hoping to learn Gatsby &/or anyone that wants an easy way to walk away with a fully functioning website of their own at the end of the course.
