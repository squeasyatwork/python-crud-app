It took me months to burn trhough it, and nothing was really straightforward, majority of work was done outside of the course, researching and reading docs, but course gave me structure what to reasearch and helped me to navigate and go back to review MANY topics covered.\n\nNeil, thank you so much for effort and constant support you've put into this course. You've changed my career and life.

Neil presents a real-world approach to learning Angular and .NET Core by walking step-by-step through the development an application. Each lesson builds on each principle as the solution takes shape. The course then covers deployment to various platforms, and covers solutions to some of the issues you may encounter. Neil goes above and beyond by constantly keeping the course updated as Angular and .NET evolve.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "11 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 82143992, "content": "Practical and detail explanations.", "rating": 4.5, "created": "2021-04-10T23:21:48Z", "modified": "2021-04-11T16:03:12Z", "user_modified": "2021-04-10T23:22:44Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 114294304, "title": "Prashant Gadekar", "name": "Prashant", "display_name": "Prashant Gadekar", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "PG"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Practical and detail explanations.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "5 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 75242250, "content": "too complicated and too much knowledge required before hand", "rating": 2.5, "created": "2021-01-13T20:24:34Z", "modified": "2021-01-14T15:06:36Z", "user_modified": "2021-01-13T20:24:54Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 101812822, "title": "Rekkala Lakshmilavanya", "name": "Rekkala", "display_name": "Rekkala Lakshmilavanya", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "RL"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>too complicated and too much knowledge required before hand</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "8 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 76563584, "content": "great experience", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2021-01-30T02:34:43Z", "modified": "2021-05-12T22:20:52Z", "user_modified": "2021-05-12T22:20:52Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 96291180, "title": "jagat lakhawala", "name": "jagat", "display_name": "jagat lakhawala", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "JL"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>great experience</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "8 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 68547267, "content": "Really enjoyed the course, Neil was easy to listen too and informed about angular and what little bootstrap was in the project.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2020-10-15T14:18:32Z", "modified": "2020-10-16T07:11:48Z", "user_modified": "2020-10-15T14:21:17Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 99823068, "title": "Mark Beatty", "name": "Mark", "display_name": "Mark Beatty", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "MB"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Really enjoyed the course, Neil was easy to listen too and informed about angular and what little bootstrap was in the project.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "11 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 70084786, "content": "I have completed the course and thoroughly enjoyed the learning.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2020-11-08T00:05:49Z", "modified": "2020-11-09T07:04:01Z", "user_modified": "2020-11-08T00:06:28Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 41733480, "title": "Mohit Acharya", "name": "Mohit", "display_name": "Mohit Acharya", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "MA"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>I have completed the course and thoroughly enjoyed the learning.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "10 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 84559096, "content": "just started so can't really say nothing now", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2021-05-10T06:42:12Z", "modified": "2021-05-11T16:05:50Z", "user_modified": "2021-05-10T06:42:44Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 82196164, "title": "Massum Hussain", "name": "Massum", "display_name": "Massum Hussain", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "MH"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>just started so can't really say nothing now</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 months ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 75748672, "content": "This has been very good so far, I am an intermediate python user, use it most days for my degree and for extended learning so moving to C# has been different but very interesting.

As I started doing this using this course, I really like the way Neil teaches and ow mush stuff his put into this course. Also, Neil updates this course to the latest one( Hard to find something on Udemy). I  only paid $10.00 for this when I bought it. So Thanks you so much Neil to putting such an awesome course together and making it affordable for anyone. Thank you so much.

The JWT part was especially well done, and the photo uploading section is a real gem.\n\nThe app feels real world and its great to see how all the moving parts all come together. Learned some new tricks using the development tools too.

The course takes the approach of building one web application and enhancing it throughout the course, and I think that is a good approach.  Not only do you learn about Angular and .Net Core web APIs, but you learn how to make them co-exist in one solution and work with both in VS Code, which is a topic I have not seen elsewhere.  In addition, you will learn about EF Core, work with a cloud image-storage service called Cloudinary, and utilize Bootstrap CSS classes and the ngx-bootstrap library to make a nice-looking site.  The course also covers building and publishing your solutions to production, which is also seldom covered.
