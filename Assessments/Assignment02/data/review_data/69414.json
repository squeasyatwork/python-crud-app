The pace of the course is great and easy to follow. A big plus : Chris also has a very agreeable voice! <br>All the mark-up in the course files is clear, well-structured, and well-commented - great for ulterior reference. I specifically appreciated the extra explanations & tips at the end of the course ( lecture 33 ) to help with future designs & problems that may arise with various email clients.<br>Most importantly, at the end of this course, which took me roughly 4 hours to complete at a leisurely speed, I now know EXACTLY what to do to make my email designs responsive and how to test them.  All in all, a great, well-rounded course!<br>I look forward to taking the next Chris Converse course!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "6 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 30230888, "content": "The course is excellent but should cover all the aspects of HTML forms.
