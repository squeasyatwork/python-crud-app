Sometimes I wished for a deeper explanation what dotnet does in the background of the framework and why it is important to use that line of code now (and what happens if you don't). But in general this course provides everything you need to get started with your own API project. I also liked that he used AutoMapper, that was missing in another course I've watched from him, so that added some additional value for me.</p>\n\n<p>In general Bhrugen is a very good tutor in my opinion, but sometimes he rushes through some stuff and you have to go back and rewind a lot. In this course it happend more frequently than in \"Complete guide to ASP.NET Core MVC (v3.1)\" which I can really recommonend. Compared to the other course, this course is a bit flat, but as I said, you'll get everything to get started and I can still take away a lot from it.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 46216720, "content": "Very good course on building APIs using .Net Core.
