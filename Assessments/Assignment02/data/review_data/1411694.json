I have rerated this course multiple times. I am just not sure what properly represents this course. Not everyone can teach and, I find it extremely irritating to hear how often he says dumb, super simple, and stupid. Great, he knows React but as someone who is trying to learn this isn't something you want to hear over and over again. It may be simple or dumb to him but, someone trying to grasp or learn something still needs to understand. If you have never studied React to any degree this is not the first course you should be taking. There are to many things glossed over and then, if he does it again he simply states you already know this and does it super fast. For someone that knows React enough, this is not a problem. If you are new or still don't feel overly comfortable; I see this as a problem. There is an extraordinary amount of copy/pasting which for a new person is not helping you out. You should be typing every line of code over and over so that it sinks in and becomes second nature. Personally when he copy/pasted, I typed everything out myself. And can attest to the fact it becomes second nature. I don't have to think about it when creating a new component or moving from functional to class based and/or vice versa.\n\nIf you want to better grasp hooks or understand what they do, this course uses a lot more than any other course I have taken. This includes using hooks for Redux which in turn means that basic knowledge of Redux without hooks is glossed over or not shown at all. It's great to know the latest way to do something and use it but, you should also know the fundamentals of the library and, not every business will be using hooks. \n\nThe videos are far from clean. You will listen to him talk about how he has been sick, his computer has bugs, his errors in code where he claims he turned the videos off without realizing it while fixing the code. You will watch him find websites, search through websites, basically unorganized lectures that were not cleaned up and again when watching video after video becomes annoying. You will trash your own code over and over again. Basically his teaching style is a chaotic mess and a lot of it is a \"lets get this done and out kind of thing because you already know it.\" \n\nI have no issue with the fact he knows the source materials and, for someone with a foundation of knowledge would likely learn something new but, if you yourself are new I am not sure this is a good place to start. Rather a good place to come back to for a different perspective or a more in-depth knowledge of hooks.\n\nPart of my redoing the rating for the fourth or fifth time and increasing it a half star is that on the final project, he uses versioning of the various pieces brought in through NPM. This means that if the course becomes outdated, as his previous course was, you will still be able to follow along. If for example you were to use the latest version of MongoDB versus the version he specifies, your program may not work.

Review updated (1/30/21). I have rerated this course multiple times. I am just not sure what properly represents this course. Not everyone can teach and, I find it extremely irritating to hear how often he says dumb, super simple, and stupid. Great, he knows React but as someone who is trying to learn this isn't something you want to hear over and over again. It may be simple or dumb to him but, someone trying to grasp or learn something still needs to understand. If you have never studied React to any degree this is not the first course you should be taking. There are to many things glossed over and then, if he does it again he simply states you already know this and does it super fast. For someone that knows React enough, this is not a problem. If you are new or still don't feel overly comfortable; I see this as a problem. There is an extraordinary amount of copy/pasting which for a new person is not helping you out. You should be typing every line of code over and over so that it sinks in and becomes second nature. Personally when he copy/pasted, I typed everything out myself. And can attest to the fact it becomes second nature. I don't have to think about it when creating a new component or moving from functional to class based and/or vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to better grasp hooks or understand what they do, this course uses a lot more than any other course I have taken. This includes using hooks for Redux which in turn means that basic knowledge of Redux without hooks is glossed over or not shown at all. It's great to know the latest way to do something and use it but, you should also know the fundamentals of the library and, not every business will be using hooks. </p>\n\n<p>The videos are far from clean. You will listen to him talk about how he has been sick, his computer has bugs, his errors in code where he claims he turned the videos off without realizing it while fixing the code. You will watch him find websites, search through websites, basically unorganized lectures that were not cleaned up and again when watching video after video becomes annoying. You will trash your own code over and over again. Basically his teaching style is a chaotic mess and a lot of it is a \"lets get this done and out kind of thing because you already know it.\" </p>\n\n<p>I have no issue with the fact he knows the source materials and, for someone with a foundation of knowledge would likely learn something new but, if you yourself are new I am not sure this is a good place to start. Rather a good place to come back to for a different perspective or a more in-depth knowledge of hooks.</p>\n\n<p>Part of my redoing the rating for the fourth or fifth time and increasing it a half star is that on the final project, he uses versioning of the various pieces brought in through NPM. This means that if the course becomes outdated, as his previous course was, you will still be able to follow along. If for example you were to use the latest version of MongoDB versus the version he specifies, your program may not work. By specifying this versioning, it means that you will be using the same set up he is using and therefore are able to continue to follow along even if things have moved on to something newer. This is a huge plus as his previous iteration of this class just crashed out and you couldn't make it very far before his materials were outdated.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 17805528, "content": "Excellent course to get started building web apps using the most common react stack.
