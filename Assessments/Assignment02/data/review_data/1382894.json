I was expecting to be trained to use \"Cycles\" rendering starting with a basic to more specific rendering in different lighting conditions with different types of environments, meaning a few indoor and outdoor environments. This wasn't the case. Instead the course focuses on creating a forest scene all the way from creating the model to the final render. Creating the models and texture mapping them was definitely not what I was expecting. As well, artistically I didn't find the forest scene interesting. Actually, I found the final image ugly. Still, the course covers a number of helpful techniques and there are a number of details to be learned that I appreciate in the course. In particular, working with all the nodes is covered in most detail. The actual tweaking of render settings for Cycles is fairly basic and minimal in the course. I recommend looking carefully at the course contents before signing-up, as it is not \"Cycles\" specific and may not be what you're expecting.
