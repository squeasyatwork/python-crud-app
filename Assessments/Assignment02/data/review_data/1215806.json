The person teaching this course is not an instructor, but rather they are a developer trying to be an instructor without any instructional skills. He was all over the place with his instruction.

It appears there was no syllabus followed and he was made up as he went.\nThe video was choppy and the frame rate lagged in a number of places.\nInstructor is all over the pace with the topics within the lectures. The lectures are not in depth. Not inclusive learning with regard to how to get from point A to point B within the code, which there was very little. \nHow is this an .Net course? The very basic code he presented was for the API, which showed little to nothing about how to build an API. The rest of the code was AJAX. This is not acceptable. The course description is very misleading with regard to \u201cBuild a Web Service from Scratch\u201d. 10 basic lectured with nothing in depth.\nThere were no files with the code samples he used. Very basic instruction on Authentication. Nothing very useful there. Meaning, how do you implement the authentication in your API without hardcoding the parameters? How do you grab the token dynamically? Where\u2019s the connection between the database and the api? Using a third party app, i.e. Postman, without going into detail as to how to use it is unacceptable.
