While he does a pretty good job at going back and telling you why he did it, you don't benefit from watching him code and and hearing his thoughts on the code, as he creates it.  It would be acceptable to start with a base template that is required to get AngularJS to run, but don't paste the entire file at one time.\n3) In the lesson about cookies, he doesn't even tell you where he got the URL for the file from.  I ended up searching Google APIs for it.  In a later lesson, he tells you that you can find these files on the AngularJS website.  That doesn't do anyone any good, unless they aren't doing lessons in order.\n4) Lessons 21 is the same video as Lesson 10.  He didn't even try.\n5) In the final (and only) quiz, the questions aren't completely clear and asks one of the questions in such a way that I don't think he even used the terminology during the course.\n\nI'm not sure if I would recommend this lesson for anyone else.

You go back to a few key concepts that are required to get the language going, but if it isn't required, he never talks about it again.<br>2) About half way through the course, he got lazy and just started pasting in code, instead of walking you through it as he did it.  While he does a pretty good job at going back and telling you why he did it, you don't benefit from watching him code and and hearing his thoughts on the code, as he creates it.  It would be acceptable to start with a base template that is required to get AngularJS to run, but don't paste the entire file at one time.<br>3) In the lesson about cookies, he doesn't even tell you where he got the URL for the file from.  I ended up searching Google APIs for it.  In a later lesson, he tells you that you can find these files on the AngularJS website.  That doesn't do anyone any good, unless they aren't doing lessons in order.<br>4) Lessons 21 is the same video as Lesson 10.  He didn't even try.<br>5) In the final (and only) quiz, the questions aren't completely clear and asks one of the questions in such a way that I don't think he even used the terminology during the course.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure if I would recommend this lesson for anyone else.  I feel like I could have just watched this all on YouTube for free.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "5 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 2604536, "content": "Sound is low or lots of background noises, doesn't explain about Angular bootstrap DOM.
