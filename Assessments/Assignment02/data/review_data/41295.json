Sections 6 to 12 is an OLD ARCHIVE course taught by Brad Traversy which largely overlaps in same content but some of the non-overlapping content is outdated and redundant, although, there are some elements that are useful that isn't covered in the new course such as web storage and geolocation. Nevertheless, I completed both.\n\nQuite frankly, the new course taught by Leslie is all you need and IMHO, a vastly superior course in the way its taught and delivered to engage you. That's not to say the old course (Brad's) is bad, far from it. Brad himself has a huge respected following on youtube and is revered but I feel he is very old school in the way he teaches and compared to Leslie's dynamic and engaging delivery. I find doing Brad's course to be very laborious but that's probably because I lack patience. But I consider Brad's course as bonus content, a reference for some elements not covered by Leslie.\n\nSo with that out of the way, I will purely focus my thoughts on Leslie's course (ie sections 1 to 5)\n\nThis course only costs twenty quid WITHOUT discount. So I expected just a basic introduction to HTML...from scratch as advertised.\n\nI got so much more than that! In fact, after finishing Leslie's course, I had the confidence to build and publish my own desired website (and of course my first) complete with user form entry with data stored on the back end server. I never imagined I would reach this point with this course and in such a short space of time.\n\nThis is because the course delivers much more than what is advertised. Not only do we learn HTML and CSS but also, flexbox, CSS grid, frameworks (we use Materialize here), javascript, Git version control, and deploying live with backend user data storage. All of which provided me with a fantastic huge stepping stone into the wider world of web development but enough for me to create my own substantial website, right now with confidence. All I need to learn next is a couple of back end applications, like node.js and MySql or equivalent pairing to complete my personal website project.\n\nBut what astounds me is how quickly I got to this point. It literally only took me one week. I did one section per day (approx one hour).\n\nThis is all thanks to Leslie's energetic delivery and course structure. No preamble on PowerPoint theory, just a brief demo of what we aiming for and then we get down and dirty towards achieving the aim. It's exhilarating and hugely satisfying.\n\nAn important factor I place highly in my decision to buying an online course is support. I am glad to say that this course has a teaching assistant that is answering student questions almost every day and has been helping most students, although sometimes, I find he/she sometimes misunderstands the question. The course instructors do not answer as I think they were probably contracted for delivering the courses. But what matters is that there is a Q&A teaching assistant. Big chunky tick in the box!. Well done.\n\nEvery section has a quiz comprising 5 questions. That is welcome but if you get any wrong, you don't get any explanations for why it is right or wrong or any reference to review a specific lecture.\n\nAre there flaws? Yes, plenty but the flaws are far outweighed by the benefits and enjoyment delivered and for the value of the course.\n\nI'll be brief with the flaws. Leslie makes a couple of mistakes in code but doesn't realise it. Both of these mistakes I highlight in the Q&A. You know I said this is two courses, one new and one old? The course doesn't tell us that at all. There is no video explaining this. They just let you discover that yourself. I think that is naughty of the Eduonix company to do that. But you can see for yourself if you expand the course content, you will see that Section 6 is \"Introduction to HTML\"....which of course we already get that from section 1. \n\nIf you want to develop and publish a good looking responsive website with user form interaction and feel accomplished in knowing the root language of your website so that you have complete control on every detail, and you want to learn this FAST and enjoy the journey with an energetic, playful instructor then I highly recommend this course.\n\nUPDATE: 18 days later.  I originally gave this 5 stars and it is a 5 star course in terms of content delivered and the excellent delivery.  But I will now deduct half a star because it seems after I finished the course, the teaching assistants have been absent ever since.  If this coninues to be the case for another two weeks, I will reduce my rating further to reflect.  I care deeply not just for my own development but for my fellow students whos questions are not being answered.", "rating": 4.5, "created": "2020-08-08T07:19:52Z", "modified": "2020-08-19T12:52:17Z", "user_modified": "2020-08-19T12:52:17Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 7414966, "title": "Tej Dyal", "name": "Tej", "display_name": "Tej Dyal", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/7414966_adc4.jpg", "initials": "TD"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>I have completed the entire course.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to know that sections 1 to 5 (6 hours of video) is THE MAIN COURSE taught by Leslie Zavarella.

So I expected just a basic introduction to HTML...from scratch as advertised.</p>\n\n<p>I got so much more than that! In fact, after finishing Leslie's course, I had the confidence to build and publish my own desired website (and of course my first) complete with user form entry with data stored on the back end server. I never imagined I would reach this point with this course and in such a short space of time.</p>\n\n<p>This is because the course delivers much more than what is advertised. Not only do we learn HTML and CSS but also, flexbox, CSS grid, frameworks (we use Materialize here), javascript, Git version control, and deploying live with backend user data storage. All of which provided me with a fantastic huge stepping stone into the wider world of web development but enough for me to create my own substantial website, right now with confidence. All I need to learn next is a couple of back end applications, like node.js and MySql or equivalent pairing to complete my personal website project.</p>\n\n<p>But what astounds me is how quickly I got to this point. It literally only took me one week. I did one section per day (approx one hour).</p>\n\n<p>This is all thanks to Leslie's energetic delivery and course structure. No preamble on PowerPoint theory, just a brief demo of what we aiming for and then we get down and dirty towards achieving the aim. It's exhilarating and hugely satisfying.</p>\n\n<p>An important factor I place highly in my decision to buying an online course is support. I am glad to say that this course has a teaching assistant that is answering student questions almost every day and has been helping most students, although sometimes, I find he/she sometimes misunderstands the question. The course instructors do not answer as I think they were probably contracted for delivering the courses. But what matters is that there is a Q&A teaching assistant. Big chunky tick in the box!. Well done.</p>\n\n<p>Every section has a quiz comprising 5 questions. That is welcome but if you get any wrong, you don't get any explanations for why it is right or wrong or any reference to review a specific lecture.</p>\n\n<p>Are there flaws? Yes, plenty but the flaws are far outweighed by the benefits and enjoyment delivered and for the value of the course.</p>\n\n<p>I'll be brief with the flaws. Leslie makes a couple of mistakes in code but doesn't realise it. Both of these mistakes I highlight in the Q&A. You know I said this is two courses, one new and one old? The course doesn't tell us that at all. There is no video explaining this. They just let you discover that yourself. I think that is naughty of the Eduonix company to do that. But you can see for yourself if you expand the course content, you will see that Section 6 is \"Introduction to HTML\"....which of course we already get that from section 1. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to develop and publish a good looking responsive website with user form interaction and feel accomplished in knowing the root language of your website so that you have complete control on every detail, and you want to learn this FAST and enjoy the journey with an energetic, playful instructor then I highly recommend this course.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: 18 days later.  I originally gave this 5 stars and it is a 5 star course in terms of content delivered and the excellent delivery.  But I will now deduct half a star because it seems after I finished the course, the teaching assistants have been absent ever since.  If this coninues to be the case for another two weeks, I will reduce my rating further to reflect.  I care deeply not just for my own development but for my fellow students whos questions are not being answered.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 17635130, "content": "Un curso excelente, esta en ingles pero es muy entendible, aunque deberia explicar un poco mas el tema de geolocalizacion, pero para empezar en el mundo de la programacion web es muy buen curso.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2018-06-13T19:41:23Z", "modified": "2018-07-27T01:48:04Z", "user_modified": "2018-07-27T01:48:04Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 28267640, "title": "Diego Eduardo Ramirez Simental", "name": "Diego Eduardo", "display_name": "Diego Eduardo Ramirez Simental", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "DR"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Un curso excelente, esta en ingles pero es muy entendible, aunque deberia explicar un poco mas el tema de geolocalizacion, pero para empezar en el mundo de la programacion web es muy buen curso.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 60334836, "content": "long videos, should be less in time, it will be better. \nbasic information\nrepetitive explanation of same thing", "rating": 1.0, "created": "2020-07-04T19:10:40Z", "modified": "2020-07-05T22:08:43Z", "user_modified": "2020-07-05T22:08:43Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 16217302, "title": "Joe Charles Sleiman", "name": "Joe Charles", "display_name": "Joe Charles Sleiman", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "JS"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>long videos, should be less in time, it will be better. <br>basic information<br>repetitive explanation of same thing</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 5806866, "content": "It was a great course , simple to follow and understand.

The typo errors/mistakes whatever you are doing on the screen also helpful to us (it works, some thing like, lessons learnt to us).  Overall, your effort, help us is appreciated and please take care of the above feedback while designing the paid course so that people do not feel unsatisfied and your effort will not go in vain.
