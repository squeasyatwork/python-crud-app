Stephen is a very good tutor. He is easy to understand, and is clearly very knowledgeable in this subject. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to start writing smart contracts, learning about blockchain technology.... but also wants to learn Javascript (I am a C# developer so i only know small amounts of JS) and how to utilise the smart contract. I also appreciate Stephen showing us how he lays out his project folder structure.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 14480150, "content": "Perfect is the word that comes to my mind while writing review comments for this course.\nActually it was like reading a great novel which one can not put down and read through to the finish.\nVery engaging and knowledgeable instructor and very well thought out course content.\nA sincere 'THANK YOU' to Stephen Grider and Udemy.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2018-03-09T01:42:58Z", "modified": "2018-05-22T15:23:23Z", "user_modified": "2018-03-09T07:15:39Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 21265870, "title": "Subhadeep Basu", "name": "Subhadeep", "display_name": "Subhadeep Basu", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/21265870_fae5.jpg", "initials": "SB"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>Perfect is the word that comes to my mind while writing review comments for this course.<br>Actually it was like reading a great novel which one can not put down and read through to the finish.<br>Very engaging and knowledgeable instructor and very well thought out course content.<br>A sincere 'THANK YOU' to Stephen Grider and Udemy.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "3 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 15742380, "content": "Just completed the course.\nI actually feel like I could build a project on Ethereum from scratch.\nGreat teacher, very experienced.
