Yes you may have seen I copied the generated token from the Postman in the Web API controller as I am stepping through the code. The generated JWT is unique every time it is generated and you can also explore and review the generated token in the jwt.io portal. I have also included the source code of this course in video 6 of Section 2. And when you generate your own jwt token, make sure to use your localhost port number in your code.\nRegarding the versioning, various options are demonstrated including the use of HeaderApiVersionReader which lets you keep your API URL clean and the API version information can be passed via appending an HTTP header which as you can see is configured in the startup.cs class. My apologies if it was not very clear to you. All the very best and thanks once again for your input!", "created": "2021-06-06T06:47:21Z", "modified": "2021-06-06T06:47:21Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 15711754, "title": "Aftab Syed", "name": "Aftab", "display_name": "Aftab Syed", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/15711754_cd00_3.jpg", "initials": "AS"}, "content_html": "<p>Thank you Noorulla for your kind feedback.
