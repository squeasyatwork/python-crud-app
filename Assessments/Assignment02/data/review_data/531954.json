The instructor is constantly making coding mistakes, but he doesn't have the sense to re-record that part of the video and not make the mistake. Instead, he keeps the recorder running while he puzzles out what's going wrong. The viewer can usually see what the mistake is right away, but we are forced to watch while he figures it out. I can only surmise that this guy doesn't know how to edit videos.<br>3. Some videos end literally in mid-sentence. Then the next \"lecture\" begins with the second half of the sentence. <br>4. Every lesson begins with a LONG process of installing and configuring various tools. This never goes well the first time. There are always errors. It is an EXHAUSTING process to even get to the point where the student can start coding.<br>5. The instructor doesn't know the subject matter. He repeatedly makes the mistake of double-registering his controllers: once in the HTML and then again in a route.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "5 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 5760290, "content": "So far so good.
