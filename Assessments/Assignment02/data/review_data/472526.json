I have experienced 100s of issues with students using local machine installs, including PHPStorm. Also, remember that this course is about PHP coding and not an in-depth review of an IDE. By keeping things simple it makes it easier for complete beginners to get coding quickly. CodeAnywhere is free for the basic account which gives 2 hours per day. For those wanting even more time the next level can be purchased for a mere $3 for a month which would allow most users to complete the course. I actually recommend to my students not to code for more that 1 hour per day when going through this course. Repeating a little each day is better than cramming everything into many hours in 1 day. CodeAnywhere can also be used from any machine anywhere. It is used by many 1000s of professional developers worldwide so it really is real life too :-)\n\nHowever, the major benefit of using CodeAnywhere for this course is that I can easily support students as they can share their code or even their developer box. I can quickly log in, fix an issue, talk them through a fix, or even add comments to the code to help them. I can not do this easily (or at all in some cases) on a local machine install.\n\nI have used most online and local machine editors. After many years and seeing many students struggle with local installation issues due to so many operating systems variations, platforms, local machine variables etc I have found that CodeAnywhere is the best option, by far, for the majority of my students including 100% of my face-to-face classes.\n\nI do mention at the beginning of the course that students are free to use any editor they wish...and some do. However, I do not believe it would be wise to start adding multiple videos about various editors as this will confuse beginners.

If I could suggest one thing to  improve this course for someone like me...I would really like a course taking PHP to the next level (intermediate to difficult), with particular emphasis on MySQL PHP.  Especially if it were presented by this lecturer, as Patrick makes the subject matter so clear and straightforward. Now, THAT would be a course!!   But still, a great intro course and really well presented.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "5 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 6705746, "content": "The instructor's voice is clear, and his video content is concise.
