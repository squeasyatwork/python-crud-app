The scope of topics that the course tries to cover is also very wide and the use of different technologies  for similar purposes in each unit has left me somewhat frustrated as I feel that I haven't grasped the first technology before moving onto another. This is likely due to the fact that most technologies are taught using a 'copy and paste' method.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I would so far recommend this course to people who wish to gain a brief insight into specific technologies and packages before delving into the topics in further detail in their own time. If you wish to gain mastery of the technologies covered in this course, expect to spend a lot of time undertaking self-study through documentation or YouTube videos in addition to completing the course.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware that some versions of the packages and databases used in this course have changed a fair amount since this course was created and so Google is your friend.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "4 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 716378, "content": "It is a well organized course, this course had helped me in learning and building projects with ease.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2015-10-13T04:28:53Z", "modified": "2015-10-13T11:28:54Z", "user_modified": "2015-10-13T11:28:54Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 14265422, "title": "Quinton Rabada", "name": "Quinton", "display_name": "Quinton Rabada", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "QR"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>It is a well organized course, this course had helped me in learning and building projects with ease.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "5 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 713578, "content": "Great and helpful course.
