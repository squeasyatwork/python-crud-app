Developers already familiar with typing or object-oriented programming will likely find more benefit in this course than those not familiar.\n\nI think the instructor did an adequate job covering the basic concepts introduced in TypeScript. What I didn't like was that the teaching code and exercises were too simplistic. The instructor doesn't build upon previous lessons or demonstrate everything coming together in any \"real-world\" project. \n\nThese sort of teaching techniques are a great way to demonstrate best practices with the language and gives the student an opportunity to build something more useful. The lack of any such project was disappointing.\n\nThe course also felt rushed. For a developer with typed language experience that wants to learn the TypeScript syntax quickly, it's excellent.

If you are thinking this course will cover advanced topics then this course is not for you. If you have some experience in Object Oriented Programming then it could even be a plus. Some of my comments about why I gave this rating are as follows:\n\n- Until Section 7 things seem to make sense and they are quite easy to understand if a totally new guy (with little programming experience) wants to give it a try. \n\n- Section 8 and 9 explanation could have been better. Generics and Decorators are two big things in TypeScript.  There I felt that things could have been told in a more practical way and with more details. As these two topics can be daunting for newbies. Sometimes only giving links to official documents can't help people rather this could make them more confused.\n\n- Overall this course could have been much better if there was the addition of an example walkthrough tutorial of a fully working application. I feel the example of React could have been replaced with a better explanation of the more advanced topics in TypeScript. That uses all the concepts presented in the course. This would have given a practical perspective on how to use the different capabilities of TypeScript.", "rating": 3.0, "created": "2019-03-14T06:43:34Z", "modified": "2019-03-15T00:07:38Z", "user_modified": "2019-03-14T07:08:24Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 34600202, "title": "Fahim Mahmood Mir", "name": "Fahim Mahmood", "display_name": "Fahim Mahmood Mir", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "FM"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>If you are thinking to know what typescript is and its basics then this course can help you in that regard.
