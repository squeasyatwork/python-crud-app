What I mean by that is that much of the material was easily digested, and there was some that will take more study and practice to feel comfortable when applying it to a project. Something I want to do is break down the more challenging areas into what I would call demonstration areas or templates that could be pulled up when I need them in a project. In other words, I want to create a library of templates that I could drop into a project and make the drop in fully functional with only minor modification.

I learned so much more than I thought I would just through his free content alone that I decided to get more serious and buy some of his courses. This course is a must have for any beginner.\n\nBrad speaks in a very relaxed tone and moves at a steady pace. He dives deep into the applications of the lessons he teaches and gives you a lot of room for inspiration and where to go on your own. Plus, he very rarely ever speaks of things you can do without showing you how to do it.

The course has a rapid build-up, that I experienced as fast enough to be challenging, yet slow enough to keep things comprehensive. \n\nThis course does not employ a hold-your-hand style of teaching. Technical concepts are explained well, but I would advise students to definitely code along from scratch with the videos rather than simply watch them passively. Also make sure to regularly pause the video to research certain concepts in greater depth, and whatever you do, takes notes! \nEspecially during later projects, you may want to take some time to do the math on why Mr Traversy chooses certain heights, widths, and similar values; as the course mainly focuses on the workings of the code itself, explanations of such details are sparse, but trying to backwards-engineer the reasoning behind certain design choices can really deepen your understanding of the course material. \n\nAn aspect that especially liked about the course is Mr Traversy's honesty. When he makes a mistake during a project, he does not edit it out, but instead highlights it and makes a point of showing how he solves it. This gives a realistic view of web development, as even professionals make mistakes, and retracing your steps to solve the resulting problems is vital.\n\nAs to cons, I would like to point out that some of the  services referenced in the lectures require payment (such as certain hosting platforms). This was an unpleasant surprise that kept me from actually doing some of the exercises. However, I did not feel that this damaged my learning experience. \n\nAlso note that later sections in the course may be a bit too fast-paced for absolute beginners. When you reach the sections on web hosting and Sass, prepare to do additional research on how to use the command line, NodeJS, Git, and similar concepts, especially if this is your first web development course. Some of the commands Mr Traversy uses did not work as expected on my machine, and required small modifications that I had to search for online. Nevertheless, I think that this is another normal part of (learning) web development, so I do not think it should discourage students from taking this course.  \n\nFinally, I have slightly mixed feelings about the Q&A section. It seems the section is being monitored, because most questions are answered fairly quickly. However, answers are often very brief, sometimes to the point of not actually solving the problem.

Brad Traversy is awesome. He sets a great pace for learning, is well organized, and is simply an excellent teacher.

This course goes well beyond basic CSS and HTML which I am very thankful for. Flexbox and CSS Grid were explained excellently and I can easily see myself being confused with those topics if it weren't for Brad's videos on them. The introduction to Sass and even a bit of npm and git were soooo helpful. I was very confused with npm and did not fully understand git and this little bit of exposure really went a long way for me. Overall, this was probably one of the best courses I've taken on Udemy and I am excited to explore future courses with Brad. His passion is clear while watching his videos which allows me to be passionate as well in the topics. It's also important to mention that Brad teaches good practices to use for HTML and CSS for your own future use and uses modern tools.

My only complaint is that there is a lack of \"try it yourself\" emphasis on projects. Of course, you can try them yourself, but I would have enjoyed pre-project videos that lay out what we are going to make, things to take note of, and maybe some hints. That said, overall a great course and I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in learning HTML and CSS!</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 47282100, "content": "Brad is awesome, his explanation from core fundamentals to some more advances technology deserves the highest score.

This could be valid for any course, Brad.  </p>\n\n<p>Now I'll continue with the javascript course.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 57053064, "content": "i just only started and im already blown away , Brad is a really good lecturer and explains everything in detail.", "rating": 5.0, "created": "2020-06-01T05:01:48Z", "modified": "2020-06-01T07:06:37Z", "user_modified": "2020-06-01T05:03:09Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 103433649, "title": "Rudi wagner", "name": "Rudi", "display_name": "Rudi wagner", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "RW"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>i just only started and im already blown away , Brad is a really good lecturer and explains everything in detail.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 53372254, "content": "The course is really clear and concise thus far, it's easily understood and presents itself well.", "rating": 4.5, "created": "2020-05-01T11:48:23Z", "modified": "2020-05-01T20:08:40Z", "user_modified": "2020-05-01T11:48:53Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 115871004, "title": "Collin Johnson", "name": "Collin", "display_name": "Collin Johnson", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "CJ"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>The course is really clear and concise thus far, it's easily understood and presents itself well.</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "a year ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 35529940, "content": "good course... step by step instruction with tips is so good...", "rating": 4.0, "created": "2019-08-10T00:08:49Z", "modified": "2019-08-10T07:13:57Z", "user_modified": "2019-08-10T00:09:18Z", "user": {"_class": "user", "id": 34491002, "title": "Arunachalam D", "name": "Arunachalam", "display_name": "Arunachalam D", "image_50x50": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/user/50x50/anonymous_3.png", "initials": "AD"}, "response": null, "content_html": "<p>good course... step by step instruction with tips is so good...</p>", "created_formatted_with_time_since": "2 years ago"}, {"_class": "course_review", "id": 26603586, "content": "This is a great tutorial with the depth and direction of overview to HTML, CSS.
